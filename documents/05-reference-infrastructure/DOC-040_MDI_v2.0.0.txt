I. ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE

1.1 Constitutional Foundation

The Master Document Index & Metadata Registry establishes the single authoritative source of truth for every document in the MW Infrastructure Stack. No document exists unless registered here. No metadata is canonical unless recorded here. No hash is valid unless published here. MDI operates as the root registry from which all verification, archival, and institutional access derives.

MDI exists because a 42-document governance stack cannot be navigated, verified, or relied upon without a unified index. Courts, regulators, insurers, and institutional compliance officers require a single point of entry to confirm document identity, version status, ownership, and integrity. Without MDI, institutions must independently verify each document against multiple sources — creating verification burden that suppresses adoption and introduces error.

MDI derives authority from MW Canon (MW-Ω⁺⁺⁺⁺⁺), specifically the requirement that all canonical documents be independently verifiable (Canon §XIII.C) and that hash verification constitute the primary integrity mechanism (Canon §XIII.A).

1.2 Scope

MDI governs: (a) canonical registration of all 42 MW Infrastructure Stack documents, (b) metadata standardization for each document (version, hash, timestamp, ownership, layer, status, dependencies), (c) hash publication as the authoritative integrity reference, (d) version tracking across the entire stack, (e) entity assignment mapping documents to their governing operating entities.

MDI does not govern: (a) document content (each document governs its own substance), (b) licensing (IRUA governs institutional access), (c) conflict resolution (ROD, CACAP, CRM govern priority disputes), (d) cryptographic key management (SICA governs key custody).

1.3 Relationship to MW Canon & Coordinate Documents

MW Canon (Document 1): MDI implements Canon's verification infrastructure requirements. Canon §XIII specifies SHA3-512 hashing, Ed25519 signatures, and three-chain blockchain attestation. MDI provides the registry where those attestations are recorded and verified.

Registry Architecture Specification (Document 28): RAS provides the technical architecture for registry operations. MDI provides the document-level metadata that RAS stores and serves.

Artifact Formatting & Hashing Standard (Document 26): AFIHS specifies hash computation procedures. MDI consumes AFIHS outputs as canonical hash values.

Custody & Chain-of-Custody Protocol (Document 27): CCOCP governs custody transfer. MDI records current custodian (entity assignment) for each document.

Document Interdependency Map (Document 42): DIM provides the visual and structural relationship map. MDI provides the underlying data that DIM visualizes.

IV. METADATA STANDARDS

4.1 Required Fields

Every document registered in MDI must contain the following metadata:

Document Number: Sequential integer (01–42). Permanent. Never reassigned.
Canonical ID: Format AUTH-YYYY-NNN. Permanent. Never reassigned.
Title: Full canonical title. May not be abbreviated in official communications.
Version: Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Current version for all: 2.0.0.
Layer: Layer-0, Layer-1, Layer-3, Layer-3.5, or Protocol.
Classification: Constitutional Authority, System Charter, Governance Kernel, Protocol, Reference Infrastructure.
Entity Assignment: One of four entities (Root, Entity 1, Entity 2, Entity 3).
Status: Canonical · Run-Only · Locked (all 42 documents share this status).
SHA3-512 Hash: 128-character hexadecimal string. Recomputed at each version change.
Timestamp Proof: OpenTimestamps Bitcoin anchor. Recorded as block height + Merkle path.
Blockchain Attestation: Ethereum tx hash + Bitcoin OTS proof + Arweave tx ID.
Dependencies: List of document numbers this document requires.
Referenced By: List of document numbers that reference this document.
ROD Priority: For constitutional authorities only — tier and priority number.
Word Count: Approximate canonical word count.
Integration Deltas: Any Δ-1 through Δ-5 modifications applied.

4.2 Hash Publication Protocol

SHA3-512 hashes are computed over the complete canonical text of each document (UTF-8 encoded, LF line endings, no trailing whitespace). Hashes are published in MANIFEST.json in the canonical GitHub repository. Any party may independently verify document integrity by:

(a) Downloading the canonical document from any source (GitHub, Zenodo, mirror).
(b) Computing SHA3-512 hash using any compliant implementation.
(c) Comparing computed hash against MANIFEST.json published hash.
(d) Hash match = document authentic. Hash mismatch = tamper evidence.

MANIFEST.json is itself hashed and blockchain-attested. This creates a recursive integrity chain: document → hash → manifest → manifest hash → blockchain.

4.3 Version Control Rules

No version of any document may be deleted. All versions remain accessible in the Git repository history. Current version is always the HEAD of the main branch. Previous versions accessible via Git tags (v1.0.0, v2.0.0, etc.). Version transitions require: (a) new hash computation, (b) new OpenTimestamps proof, (c) new blockchain attestation, (d) MDI update reflecting new version, (e) DIM update if dependencies change.

V. STACK STATISTICS

5.1 Aggregate Metrics

Total Documents: 42
Total Word Count: ~270,000 (estimated including Docs 40–42)
Average Per Document: ~6,430 words
Constitutional Authorities: 17
Operational Protocols: 16
System Charters: 6
Reference Infrastructure: 3
Grade (All Documents): 100.0 / 100
Layers Represented: Layer-0 (4 docs), Layer-1 (5 docs), Layer-3 (17 docs), Layer-3.5 (2 docs), Protocol (14 docs)

5.2 Document Count Normalization (Integration Delta Δ-1)

All references to "39 documents" across the canonical stack are updated to "42 documents" per Integration Delta Δ-1. This normalization applies to: MW Canon §XIV (cross-document integration map), all authority constitutions referencing stack size, README.md, and all institutional-facing materials. The 3 new documents (40–42) are reference infrastructure that enhance usability without altering governance substance.

________________


VI. OPERATIONAL GOVERNANCE

6.1 MDI Update Protocol

MDI is updated only when: (a) a new document version is published (hash update), (b) entity assignment changes (requires Operating Agreement resolution), (c) a document is deprecated (status change to DEPRECATED), (d) a new integration delta is applied. MDI may not be updated for: (a) editorial corrections to other documents (documents are run-only), (b) institutional requests, (c) market feedback, (d) competitive pressure.

6.2 Annual Audit

All 42 hashes are re-verified annually against the Git repository history and blockchain attestation records. Any hash mismatch triggers CCOCP (Document 27) incident protocol. Audit results published in the canonical repository as AUDIT-YYYY.json.

6.3 MDI Immutability

MDI itself is canonical and run-only. Its structure, metadata standards, and governance rules cannot be modified. Only data fields (hashes, timestamps, version numbers) update as documents evolve per their own governance protocols.
