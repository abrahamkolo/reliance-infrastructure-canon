I. ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE

1.1 Constitutional Foundation

The Universal Glossary & Terminology Guide establishes canonical definitions for every material term used across the 42-document MW Infrastructure Stack. A term means exactly what UGT says it means — no more, no less. Institutional actors, courts, arbitrators, regulators, and licensees interpret terms exclusively by UGT definitions. No external dictionary, legal treatise, or industry glossary may override UGT definitions within the MW ecosystem.

UGT exists because a 42-document governance stack spanning finance, law, evidence, culture, technology, and crisis management uses specialized vocabulary that carries different meanings across disciplines. "Determinism" means one thing in physics, another in computer science, and a third in philosophy. Within MW, it means exactly one thing as defined here. Ambiguity in terminology produces ambiguity in compliance — and ambiguity in compliance is incompatible with deterministic governance.

1.2 Usage Rules

Every defined term in this glossary must be Title Cased on first use in each document section. Subsequent uses within the same section may use standard capitalization. When a defined term appears in an institutional communication, license agreement, certification, or legal proceeding, the UGT definition governs interpretation regardless of any contrary usage in the receiving jurisdiction's legal tradition.

If a term is not defined here, it carries its ordinary English meaning as determined by Black's Law Dictionary (12th Edition) for legal terms, and Merriam-Webster (current edition) for all other terms.

II. CONSTITUTIONAL & STRUCTURAL TERMS

Adversarial Survival: The capacity of a document, authority, or system to withstand intentional sabotage, hostile takeover, fraud, regulatory capture, economic attack, and social campaigns to discredit validity. MW systems must survive founder corruption, regulatory pressure, and competitive attack without modification. Test: system operates correctly when every external actor is assumed hostile. (Canon §II.A.6)

Authority: A constitutional body established by a Layer-3 document within the MW Infrastructure Stack, governing a specific institutional domain. Each Authority operates within jurisdictional boundaries defined by its constitution and the Layer Architecture Charter (Document 2). Authorities issue certifications, not advice. Authorities cannot expand scope beyond their charter. (Doc 2, §I)

Authority Hierarchy: The permanent ordering of all MW authorities from Canon (supreme) through Layer-1 charters, Layer-3 constitutional authorities, Layer-3.5 choke points, and operational protocols. No authority may override a higher-layer authority under any circumstance. Hierarchy is enforced by ROD (Document 34). (Doc 2, §IV)

Binary Compliance: Every MW certification produces exactly one of two outputs: COMPLIANT or NOT COMPLIANT. No intermediate states exist. No "substantially compliant," "partially compliant," or "compliant with conditions." An institution either meets every requirement or it does not. (Canon §II.A.1; Doc 3)

Canonical: The status of a document that has been finalized, hashed, timestamped, blockchain-attested, and locked. A canonical document admits no further modification under any circumstance. Canonical status is permanent — it cannot be revoked, suspended, or temporarily lifted. The only path from canonical is deprecation (replaced by an entirely new document, not a modified version). (Canon §I.D)

Canonical ID: A unique identifier assigned to each document in the format AUTH-YYYY-NNN where AUTH is the authority abbreviation, YYYY is the year of issuance, and NNN is the sequential document number. Canonical IDs are permanent and never reassigned, even if a document is deprecated. (Doc 40, §IV)

Constitutional Authority: One of 17 Layer-3 bodies governing specific institutional domains (IRUA, GEAA, CivicHab, GCPA, PMOA, EWA, EPA, EFAA, UPDIUD, SICA, IATA, DRFA, CRTA, IPPA, CSCA, DCPA, FAPA). Each operates under a constitution that defines scope, jurisdiction, certification standards, and operational boundaries. (Doc 2, §IV)

Cross-Document Integration Map: The structural relationship diagram (Document 42) showing how all 42 documents relate through dependencies, references, authority hierarchies, and conflict resolution pathways. (Doc 42)

Document-Bound Authority: The principle that all governance authority resides in canonical documents, not in persons, committees, boards, or institutions. No individual — including the founder — holds authority that is not explicitly documented in a canonical text. If it is not written, it does not exist. (Canon §II.A.4)

________________


III. OPERATIONAL TERMS

Activation Gate: A binary checkpoint that an Authority must pass before transitioning from dormant to active status. Gates are defined in BGDP (Document 38) and require specific conditions — institutional queries, geographic distribution, verification coverage — all of which must be met simultaneously. No partial activation. (Doc 38)

Artifact: Any output issued by an MW Authority — certifications, attestations, verification reports, compliance determinations. Every artifact receives a unique Artifact ID in the format AUTH-TYPE-YYYY-NNNNN. Artifacts are immutable once issued. (Doc 24, §II; Doc 26)

Artifact ID: The unique identifier for any artifact issued by an MW authority. Format: AUTH-TYPE-YYYY-NNNNN where AUTH is the issuing authority, TYPE is the artifact category (CERT, ATT, VER, DET), YYYY is the issuance year, and NNNNN is the sequential artifact number. (Doc 26, §I)

Blockchain Attestation: The process of recording a document hash on multiple blockchains to create independently verifiable temporal proof. MW requires three-chain attestation: Ethereum (smart contract event logs), Bitcoin (OpenTimestamps with OP_RETURN Merkle root), and Arweave (permanent metadata storage). Two of three chains must confirm for attestation validity. (Canon §XIII.A; Doc 26)

Chain-of-Custody: The documented, unbroken sequence of custodial transfers for any MW artifact from creation through current holding. Every transfer is recorded with timestamps, custodian identities, and hash verification. Custody gaps void artifact authenticity. Governed by CCOCP (Document 27). (Doc 27)

Choke Point: A Layer-3.5 authority that converts institutional reliance into revenue. The MW Infrastructure Stack has two choke points: GCRA (Document 32) and RIX (Document 33). Choke points are not constitutional authorities — they are financial conversion mechanisms. (Doc 2, §IV; Doc 5)

Collision: A conflict between two MW authorities where both claim jurisdiction over the same institutional action. Collisions are resolved deterministically by CRM (Document 36) using the priority hierarchy established in ROD (Document 34). No collision requires human judgment to resolve. (Doc 36)

Compliance Cycle: The periodic verification process ensuring an institution maintains its MW certification. Cycle frequency determined by authority-specific requirements. Failure to complete a compliance cycle on time results in automatic certification suspension. No grace periods. No extensions. (Doc 3, §III)

Conflict Avoidance: Proactive measures to prevent authority collisions before they occur. CACAP (Document 35) defines structural rules that prevent most conflicts. Conflicts that escape CACAP are resolved by ROD (Document 34) and CRM (Document 36). (Doc 35)

Dead Man's Switch: A governance mechanism that activates automatically when a specified condition occurs without requiring any human action. In the MW context: if the founder is unavailable for 14+ consecutive days, the incapacitation agent's limited power of attorney activates, enabling continuation of formation and operational tasks. (Execution Plan, P-2)

Deterministic Execution: The requirement that identical inputs produce identical outputs across time, geography, and institutional context. A certification query submitted in New York in 2025 must produce the same result as an identical query submitted in Singapore in 2075. Determinism is absolute (bit-for-bit identical), not probabilistic or approximate. (Canon §II.A.1; Doc 3)

Dormancy: The state of an MW Authority that is canonical but not actively processing institutional queries. Dormant authorities remain valid, accept queries if received, generate valid outputs, but do not actively seek adoption. Dormancy triggers include: no institutional queries for 12+ consecutive months, geographic distribution below 3 jurisdictions, or verification coverage below 8/9 domains. Managed by BGDP (Document 38). (Canon §XII; Doc 38)

________________


IV. LEGAL & GOVERNANCE TERMS

Admissibility: The qualification of an MW artifact as valid evidence in legal proceedings. GEAA (Document 8) governs the standards by which MW-issued evidence meets jurisdictional admissibility requirements across common law, civil law, and hybrid legal systems. (Doc 8; Doc 4)

Arbitration: The dispute resolution mechanism for conflicts arising from MW licensing. All disputes are resolved by ICC International Court of Arbitration (Zurich). New York Convention ensures enforcement across 172 signatory jurisdictions. No party may seek judicial resolution before exhausting ICC arbitration. (Doc 17; Doc 18)

Beneficial Ownership: The natural person(s) who ultimately own or control an institutional licensee. Required for AML/KYC compliance at Tier 4 ($250K+ license). Beneficial ownership disclosure required per FinCEN Corporate Transparency Act. (Execution Plan, Task 2.19)

Canonical Hosting: The three-tier archival system ensuring permanent document availability: Tier 1 (GitHub — primary), Tier 2 (Zenodo — academic archival with DOI), Tier 3 (Jurisdictional Mirrors — geographic redundancy). All three tiers maintain identical canonical content. (Doc 7, §3.3; Doc 29)

Citation Royalty Safe Mode: The revenue mechanism for institutional citations of MW documents. Three simultaneous gates required for activation: (a) numeric citation threshold met, (b) minimum 5 years dormancy-free operation, (c) independent fairness opinion from CPA or valuation firm. If any gate fails, mechanism remains permanently dormant. Integration Delta Δ-4. (Execution Plan, Δ-4)

Deprecation: The process by which a canonical document is replaced by an entirely new document. Deprecated documents remain accessible indefinitely for historical reference and legal citation. Deprecated documents cannot serve as primary reliance basis after deprecation date. Deprecation does not modify the deprecated document — it remains canonical in its final form. (Doc 7, §3.2)

Founder Irrelevance: The architectural principle that the MW Infrastructure Stack operates identically regardless of the founder's status — alive, dead, hostile, absent, incapacitated, or corrupted. No protocol requires founder authentication. No decision tree terminates at founder discretion. Test: execute all protocols with founder status = "deceased/unreachable/hostile." If any protocol fails, the system is non-canonical. (Canon §II.A.4)

Founder Sunset: The irrevocable transfer of all founder governance rights to the operating entity. Triggered by date-certain OR threshold-certain (whichever occurs first). Once triggered, cannot be reversed. Recorded in the Operating Agreement. Integration Delta Δ-5. (Execution Plan, Δ-5)

Governing Law: Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) governs all entity-level matters. ICC arbitration (Zurich) governs all disputes. New York Convention provides international enforcement. UETA, E-SIGN, and eIDAS govern digital signature validity. (Canon §I; all constitutions)

Institutional Reliance: The state in which an institution depends on MW certifications for operational decisions — court filings, insurance underwriting, regulatory compliance, investment governance. Once an institution relies on an MW certification, the certification creates obligations that survive authority dormancy and even authority death (retroactive voiding aside). (Doc 7)

License: The contractual right to access and cite MW canonical documents. Acquired through payment-as-contract — payment of the published fee constitutes binding acceptance. No signatures, negotiations, or contract review periods. Tiers: Tier 0 (evaluation, 30-day free), Tier 1 ($2,500/yr), Tier 2 ($10,000/yr), Tier 3 ($50,000/yr), Tier 4 ($250,000/yr). (Doc 5; Doc 7, §2.2)

Payment-as-Contract: The acceptance mechanism for MW licenses. Payment of the published fee creates a binding agreement. No signature required for Tiers 1–2. The act of payment constitutes acceptance of all license terms including liability limitations, warranty disclaimers, and dispute resolution provisions. (Doc 5; Doc 7, §2.2)

Run-Only: The operational mode of all canonical documents. Once sealed, a document executes without modification. Not for typos, not for emergencies, not for "obvious improvements." Zero amendments, ever. Run-only is not a policy choice — it is an architectural requirement for deterministic execution. (Canon §I.D; Doc 3)

Self-Certification: The compliance model in which institutions verify their own tier classification. MW does not audit institutions. Institutions self-assess and pay the corresponding tier fee. Misclassification penalty: 200% of the underpaid amount plus 6-year lookback. (Doc 7, §2.2)

________________


V. TECHNICAL TERMS

AES-256-GCM: Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit key in Galois/Counter Mode. Used for encryption at rest of all MW stored data. NIST-approved, FIPS 140-2 compliant. (Canon §XIII.A)

DOI: Digital Object Identifier. Persistent identifier assigned by Zenodo to each MW document uploaded to academic archival. Format: 10.5281/zenodo.NNNNNNN. DOIs are permanent — they resolve to the document even if Zenodo's URL structure changes. (Doc 7, §3.3; Doc 40, §IV)

Ed25519: Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm with 25519 curve. Used for digital signatures on MW documents and artifacts. FIPS 140-2 Level 3+ HSM key storage required. Multi-party authorization (2-of-3) for key operations per SICA registry. (Canon §XIII.A; Doc 16)

GPG Key: GNU Privacy Guard cryptographic key used for signing Git commits and document attestations. Current MW signing key: RSA 4096-bit, Key ID EB937371B8993E99. Key escrowed with attorney. 24-month subkey rotation cycle. (Execution Plan, §Phase 1)

Hash: A SHA3-512 cryptographic fingerprint of a document. Computed over complete UTF-8 encoded text with LF line endings and no trailing whitespace. Produces 128-character hexadecimal string. Hash verification is the primary integrity mechanism — any institution may independently verify any document. (Canon §XIII.A; Doc 26)

MANIFEST.json: The authoritative hash publication file in the canonical GitHub repository. Contains SHA3-512 hashes for all 42 documents, their version numbers, and blockchain attestation references. MANIFEST.json is itself hashed and blockchain-attested, creating recursive integrity. (Doc 40, §IV)

OpenTimestamps: Bitcoin blockchain-based timestamping protocol. Proves document existence at a specific block height without revealing document contents. Used for all 42 MW documents. Free, independent of any service provider, verifiable indefinitely. (Doc 26; Execution Plan, Phase 1)

Post-Quantum Cryptography: Cryptographic algorithms resistant to quantum computer attacks. Current MW algorithms (SHA3-512, Ed25519, RSA 4096) are secure against classical computers. When NIST PQC standards achieve broad tooling support (estimated 2027–2030), MW will evaluate migration to CRYSTALS-Dilithium for digital signatures via dual-signing transition. SHA3-512 is already quantum-resistant and will not require migration. (Canon §XIII.B; Execution Plan, Patch 58)

SHA3-512: Secure Hash Algorithm 3 with 512-bit output. NIST FIPS 202 standard. Produces 128-character hexadecimal hash. Post-quantum resistant (hash algorithms are not vulnerable to Shor's algorithm). Used as the canonical hashing standard for all MW documents and artifacts. (Canon §XIII.A)

Three-Chain Attestation: The requirement that every canonical document be attested on three independent blockchains: Ethereum (smart contract event logs), Bitcoin (OpenTimestamps with OP_RETURN), and Arweave (permanent storage). Two-of-three quorum required — if one chain fails, document remains valid. (Canon §XIII.A; Doc 26)

VI. FINANCIAL & PRICING TERMS

Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): The total value of all active institutional licenses annualized. Calculated as: sum of (each license tier × annual tier price × remaining license months / 12). Primary metric for MW system financial health. (Doc 5)

Break-Even: The point at which licensing revenue equals operating costs. For MW: 1–2 institutional licenses at Tier 2 ($10,000) covers full Year 1 cost including formation. (Execution Plan, Cost Summary)

CPI Escalation: Annual 3% price increase indexed to Consumer Price Index. Applied automatically at each license renewal. No negotiation. No exceptions. Integration Delta Δ-4 safe mode gates prevent escalation from triggering antitrust exposure. (Execution Plan, Task 2.16(h))

Net Revenue Retention (NRR): Current period ARR from existing customers divided by prior period ARR from those same customers. Target: >100% (meaning upsells exceed churn). MW target NRR: 115% driven by institutional growth triggering tier upgrades. (Capital Architecture Model)

Revenue Distribution: The formula for allocating net licensing revenue: 15% operating reserve + 10% IP protection fund + 5% infrastructure maintenance + 70% founder/entity distributions. Encoded in the Operating Agreement. (Execution Plan, Phase 2)

Tier System: The four-level institutional licensing structure: Tier 1 ($2,500/year — small institutions, <$50M revenue), Tier 2 ($10,000/year — mid-size, $50M–$500M), Tier 3 ($50,000/year — large, $500M–$5B), Tier 4 ($250,000/year — enterprise, >$5B). Self-classified by licensee with 200% misclassification penalty. (Doc 5; Doc 7)

________________


VII. ENTITY & FORMATION TERMS

DBA: "Doing Business As" — a registered trade name under which the root entity operates a specific authority or group of authorities. Entity 1, Entity 2, and Entity 3 initially operate as DBAs under Reliance Infrastructure Holdings LLC. May be elevated to separate LLCs when revenue or liability warrants. (Execution Plan, Phase 2)

Delaware DGCL: Delaware General Corporation Law. The governing statute for Reliance Infrastructure Holdings LLC and all subsidiary entities. Delaware chosen for: business-friendly Court of Chancery, extensive corporate case law, predictable outcomes, and recognition across all 50 states and internationally. (All constitutions; Execution Plan)

Entity Assignment: The mapping of each of the 42 canonical documents to exactly one operating entity. Root entity holds foundational documents. Entity 1 holds legal/arbitration documents. Entity 2 holds safety/certification documents. Entity 3 holds cultural/publishing documents. Tracked in MDI (Document 40). (Doc 40, §III)

First Reliance Event (FRE-001): The milestone at which the first external institution signs a license, submits payment to the HoldCo bank account, and confirms a specific filing or policy in which MW documents will be cited. FRE-001 activates the revenue system and provides the use-in-commerce evidence for ITU→SOU trademark conversion. (Execution Plan, Phase 5)

Operating Agreement: The governing legal document for Reliance Infrastructure Holdings LLC. Attorney-drafted. Contains: manager-managed structure, irrevocable founder sunset, IP assignment, limited POA for incapacitation agent, 15/10/5/70 revenue distribution, dissolution protocol, work-for-hire clause template. (Execution Plan, Task 2.2)

Reliance Infrastructure Holdings LLC: The root legal entity that owns all MW Infrastructure Stack intellectual property and operates all constitutional authorities through DBAs or subsidiary entities. Incorporated in Delaware. Registered as foreign LLC in the District of Columbia. (Execution Plan, Phase 2)

________________


VIII. INTEGRATION DELTA TERMS

Integration Delta: A targeted modification applied to the canonical stack during the 39→42 document migration. Five deltas (Δ-1 through Δ-5) address specific integration requirements. Deltas are surgical — they modify existing provisions without expanding scope. (Execution Plan, Phase 0)

Δ-1 (Document Count Normalization): Updates all references from "39 documents" to "42 documents" across the entire stack. Applied to every document referencing stack size.

Δ-2 (DSA Shield): Reclassifies EU Digital Services Act compliance memo in Document 6 as Defensive Interpretive Shield — non-operational, non-adaptive. Future DSA regulatory conflict triggers automatic dormancy, not document modification.

Δ-3 (Transition Cost Firewall): Classifies Document 10 transition cost calculator outputs as informational only — non-prescriptive, non-comparative. Bans use in sales, pitches, negotiations, or institutional outreach.

Δ-4 (Citation Royalty Safe Mode): Requires three simultaneous gates for citation royalty activation: numeric threshold met, 5+ years dormancy-free, independent fairness opinion. Any gate failure = permanently dormant mechanism.

Δ-5 (Founder Sunset Seal): Makes founder sunset irrevocable — triggered by date-certain OR threshold-certain (whichever first). Cannot be reversed once triggered. Recorded in Operating Agreement.
