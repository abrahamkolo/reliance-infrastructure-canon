I. ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE

1.1 Constitutional Foundation

The Document Interdependency Map & Matrix provides the complete structural relationship model for all 42 documents in the MW Infrastructure Stack. DIM answers the question every institutional actor asks first: "How do these 42 documents relate to each other?" Without DIM, navigating the stack requires reading all 42 constitutions to understand governance chains — an unreasonable burden that suppresses adoption.

DIM maps four relationship types: (a) constitutional hierarchy (which document governs which), (b) operational dependencies (which documents must exist for another to function), (c) cross-references (which documents cite which), and (d) conflict resolution paths (which documents resolve disputes between which). Every relationship is deterministic — no relationship requires interpretation or judgment to identify.

1.2 Scope

DIM governs: (a) structural relationship visualization across all 42 documents, (b) dependency chain documentation, (c) layer hierarchy enforcement verification, (d) conflict resolution path mapping, (e) impact analysis for any hypothetical document change.

DIM does not govern: (a) document content, (b) conflict resolution outcomes (ROD/CACAP/CRM govern), (c) entity assignment (MDI governs), (d) term definitions (UGT governs).

III. DEPENDENCY MATRIX

3.1 Reading the Matrix

"Depends on" means: the dependent document cannot function without the dependency document existing and being canonical. Dependencies are directional — Doc 07 depends on Doc 01, but Doc 01 does not depend on Doc 07.

3.2 Root Dependencies (Documents All Others Depend On)

Doc 01 (MW Canon): Required by all 41 other documents. The only document with zero dependencies.
Doc 02 (Layer Architecture): Required by all Layer-3, Layer-3.5, and Protocol documents.
Doc 03 (Determinism Law): Required by all documents enforcing deterministic execution.

These three documents form the "constitutional root" — if any is invalidated, the entire stack is compromised.

IV. CROSS-REFERENCE DENSITY

4.1 Most-Referenced Documents (Hub Nodes)

These documents are referenced by the largest number of other documents, making them the structural backbone of the stack:

Rank 1: Doc 01 (MW Canon) — Referenced by: 41 documents (universal)
Rank 2: Doc 02 (Layer Architecture) — Referenced by: 28 documents
Rank 3: Doc 03 (Determinism Law) — Referenced by: 29 documents
Rank 4: Doc 07 (IRUA) — Referenced by: 15 documents
Rank 5: Doc 04 (Issuance & Admissibility) — Referenced by: 17 documents
Rank 6: Doc 26 (AFIHS) — Referenced by: 5 documents
Rank 7: Doc 08 (GEAA) — Referenced by: 6 documents

Implication: Documents 01, 02, 03, 04, and 07 form the "structural core" — any institution evaluating the stack should read these first. All other documents build upon this foundation.

4.2 Terminal Documents (Leaf Nodes)

These documents have no downstream dependencies — they are endpoints:

Doc 24 (IPS), Doc 25 (BDTM), Doc 27 (CCOCP), Doc 28 (RAS), Doc 29 (MJMP), Doc 31 (CAP), Doc 33 (RIX), Doc 36 (CRM), Doc 37 (PRPM), Doc 41 (UGT), Doc 42 (DIM)

Terminal documents can be read independently after understanding their upstream dependencies. They do not affect other documents' validity.

4.3 Critical Path

The longest dependency chain in the stack determines the minimum documents an institution must read to understand any single authority:

Canon (01) → Layer Architecture (02) → Determinism (03) → Admissibility (04) → IRUA (07) → GEAA (08) → EFAA (14)

This chain is 7 documents deep. An institution seeking EFAA certification must understand all 7 upstream documents. No shortcut exists.

________________


V. CONFLICT RESOLUTION PATH MAP

5.1 How Conflicts Route Through the Stack

When two authorities claim jurisdiction over the same institutional action:

Step 1: Check CACAP (Doc 35) — was conflict preventable?
  If yes → CACAP resolution applies. No further escalation.
  If no → proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Check CRM (Doc 36) — is this a known authority pair?
  If yes → CRM deterministic resolution applies.
  If no → proceed to Step 3.

Step 3: Apply ROD (Doc 34) — general ordering doctrine.
  ROD resolves by tier priority:
    Tier Zero (Canon) supersedes all.
    Tier One supersedes Tier Two, Three, and Protocols.
    Tier Two supersedes Tier Three and Protocols.
    Within same tier, higher priority number wins.

Step 4: If ROD cannot resolve → IATA (Doc 17) arbitration.
Step 5: IATA arbitration → DRFA (Doc 18) finality.

This path is deterministic. No conflict requires human judgment at Steps 1–3. Steps 4–5 are failsafes for edge cases the designers could not anticipate.

5.2 Conflict Resolution Document Relationships

Doc 35 (CACAP) prevents → most conflicts
Doc 36 (CRM) resolves → known authority-pair conflicts
Doc 34 (ROD) resolves → all remaining priority-based conflicts
Doc 17 (IATA) arbitrates → unresolvable conflicts
Doc 18 (DRFA) finalizes → all dispute outcomes

These five documents form a complete conflict resolution pipeline. No conflict can persist unresolved — every dispute terminates at DRFA.

VI. ENTITY ASSIGNMENT OVERLAY

6.1 Entity-Document Mapping

Reliance Infrastructure Holdings LLC (Root):
  Docs 01, 02, 03, 05, 06, 40, 41, 42
  Character: Constitutional bedrock + reference infrastructure
  Revenue: Receives licensing revenue through subsidiary entities

Entity 1 — Legal–Arbitration & Admissibility:
  Docs 04, 07, 08, 15, 17, 18, 21, 24, 25, 27, 29, 30, 31, 34, 35, 36, 39
  Character: Legal infrastructure backbone — evidence, arbitration, conflict, custody
  Revenue: Primary licensing entity (IRUA + GEAA drive most institutional demand)

Entity 2 — Safety & Certification:
  Docs 09, 10, 11, 16, 19, 26, 28, 32, 33, 37, 38
  Character: Certification mechanics — standards, capital, crisis, activation
  Revenue: GCRA/RIX choke points generate financial conversion revenue

Entity 3 — Legal Codification:
  Docs 12, 13, 14, 20, 22, 23
  Character: Cultural and permanence infrastructure — works, publishing, art, IP, data, assets
  Revenue: Specialized licensing from cultural institutions, museums, publishers

6.2 Cross-Entity Dependencies

Entity 1 depends on Root: Docs 01, 02, 03, 05, 06 (constitutional foundation)
Entity 2 depends on Root: Docs 01, 02, 03, 05 (constitutional foundation)
Entity 3 depends on Root: Docs 01, 02, 03 (constitutional foundation)
Entity 2 depends on Entity 1: Doc 07 (IRUA licensing), Doc 08 (GEAA evidence)
Entity 3 depends on Entity 1: Doc 07 (IRUA licensing), Doc 08 (GEAA evidence)
Entity 3 depends on Entity 2: Doc 11 (PMOA skill development)

No circular dependencies exist. Root → Entity 1/2/3 is strictly hierarchical.

VII. IMPACT ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

7.1 Purpose

If a hypothetical change were proposed to any document (which cannot happen under run-only — but this analysis supports institutional understanding of system resilience), DIM enables impact assessment:

Step 1: Identify the document potentially affected.
Step 2: Look up its "Required By" field in the dependency table (Section III).
Step 3: Every document in "Required By" is a first-order impact.
Step 4: For each first-order impact, repeat Step 2 to find second-order impacts.
Step 5: Continue until no new documents are reached.

7.2 Impact Examples

If Doc 01 (Canon) were hypothetically invalidated:
  First-order: All 41 documents
  Result: Total system collapse (this is why Canon is immutable)

If Doc 07 (IRUA) were hypothetically invalidated:
  First-order: Docs 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 21, 23, 29, 32, 33
  Second-order: Docs 14, 19, 20, 22, 34, 36, 37, 38
  Result: 23 of 42 documents affected (55%). Licensing infrastructure collapses.

If Doc 24 (IPS) were hypothetically invalidated:
  First-order: None (terminal document)
  Result: Issuance procedures require manual specification. System continues.

This confirms the design principle: hub nodes (01, 02, 03, 07) are maximally protected because their failure cascades are catastrophic. Terminal nodes (24, 25, 28, 29) can fail without systemic impact.

VIII. INSTITUTIONAL READING ORDER

8.1 Recommended Reading Sequence for New Institutions

An institution evaluating the MW Infrastructure Stack should read documents in this order to build understanding efficiently:

Phase 1 — Orientation (3 documents, ~1 hour):
  Doc 40 (MDI) → What exists and how it's organized
  Doc 41 (UGT) → What terms mean
  Doc 42 (DIM) → How documents relate [this document]

Phase 2 — Constitutional Foundation (3 documents, ~2 hours):
  Doc 01 (Canon) → Governing principles
  Doc 02 (Layer Architecture) → Authority hierarchy
  Doc 03 (Determinism Law) → Execution model

Phase 3 — Licensing & Access (3 documents, ~1.5 hours):
  Doc 05 (Pricing) → What it costs
  Doc 06 (Non-Advice) → What you're not getting
  Doc 07 (IRUA) → How licensing works

Phase 4 — Domain-Specific (1–3 documents, ~1–3 hours):
  Read the constitution(s) relevant to the institution's certification needs:
  Law firms → Doc 08 (GEAA)
  Insurers → Doc 07 (IRUA) + Doc 10 (GCPA)
  Investment firms → Doc 10 (GCPA) + Doc 32 (GCRA)
  Museums/galleries → Doc 14 (EFAA)
  Publishers → Doc 13 (EPA)
  Urban planners → Doc 09 (CivicHab)

Phase 5 — Operational (as needed):
  Protocols (Docs 24–31) relevant to specific certification workflows
  Conflict resolution (Docs 34–36) if multi-authority certification needed

Total minimum reading for institutional evaluation: 9–12 documents, 4.5–7.5 hours. This is comparable to reviewing a typical commercial real estate transaction document package.
