I. MATRIX ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE

1.1 Constitutional Foundation

The Collision Resolution Matrix (CRM) provides deterministic decision tables resolving every possible conflict between MW Infrastructure Stack authorities through pre-specified binary outcomes. CRM operates as a comprehensive lookup system eliminating discretionary judgment when authorities issue contradictory directives, competing deadlines, or mutually exclusive requirements.

CRM exists as executable conflict resolution infrastructure. While Document 34 ROD establishes hierarchical principles and Document 35 CACAP prevents conflicts proactively, CRM provides immediate operational resolution for conflicts arising despite prevention efforts. Institutions consult CRM receiving instant deterministic answers requiring no interpretation, balancing, or case-by-case analysis.

The Matrix derives authority from MW Canon (MW-Î©âºâºâºâºâº). CRM determinations supersede authority-specific guidance, institutional preferences, and external legal opinions. Compliance with CRM resolution constitutes complete defense against enforcement by the subordinated authority. Refusal to accept CRM determination constitutes material violation triggering immediate certification suspension per Document 32.

1.2 Matrix Architecture

Primary dimensions: Authority Pair (all NÃ—N combinations where N = total authorities); Conflict Type (5 categories: temporal, resource, substantive, technical, jurisdictional); Severity Level (10-point scale); Context Variables (20 environmental factors).

Each matrix cell contains: primary resolution (default deterministic outcome); conditional resolutions (alternatives triggered by context variables); implementation guidance (step-by-step execution instructions); appeal pathway; and precedent references.

Matrix scale: 39 canonical documents generate 741 unique authority pair combinations (not 1,521 â€” the matrix is symmetric, AÃ—B = BÃ—A). Across 5 conflict types, 10 severity levels, and 20 context variables, the matrix covers every conceivable institutional conflict scenario.

1.3 Resolution Principles

Seven principles applied mechanically: hierarchy primacy (higher-tier supersedes lower per ROD); temporal priority (earlier requirements prevail absent explicit supersession); determinism protection (deterministic systems receive priority); institutional burden minimization (when authorities hold equal priority, minimize aggregate burden); reliance network preservation (network interests over isolated interests); reversibility avoidance (prevent institutional whipsaw); and constitutional alignment (all resolutions align with Canon).

1.4 Relationship to MW Canon & Coordinate Documents

Document 34 (ROD): Provides the hierarchical principles CRM operationalizes. ROD says "GCRA outranks GEAA"; CRM says "when GCRA's capital determinism requirement conflicts with GEAA's evidence presentation requirement, comply with GCRA and document the GEAA non-compliance as follows: [specific steps]."

Document 35 (CACAP): Prevents conflicts before they arise. CRM resolves conflicts that escape CACAP prevention.

Document 28 (RAS): All CRM resolutions recorded with SHA3-512 hashing and three-chain attestation.

Document 32 (GCRA): CRM non-compliance triggers certification suspension.

Legal Framework: Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws (mechanical application rather than subjective tests). Administrative Procedure Act analogy (notice-and-comment for major updates). ICC arbitration (Zurich) per IATA for disputes. New York Convention enforcement.

II. WHY CRM EXISTS

The Operational Translation Problem: Document 34 ROD establishes that "GCRA outranks GEAA" and "Tier One supersedes Tier Two." These are correct hierarchical principles â€” but they don't tell an institution's compliance officer what to do on Monday morning when she discovers that GCRA's March 31 recertification deadline requires her entire team's attention for 6 weeks, but GEAA's evidence audit is also due March 31 and requires 4 weeks of the same team's effort.

ROD provides the principle: prioritize GCRA. But the compliance officer needs operational specifics: How long can she delay GEAA? Who does she notify? What documentation does she need? Will GEAA penalize the delay? Can she request a formal extension and from whom? What if the GEAA deadline is court-ordered? What if she's also facing a Tier Two deadline in the same window?

CRM translates ROD principles into executable institutional procedures. For the specific conflict "GCRA annual recertification versus GEAA evidence audit â€” simultaneous deadline â€” Temporal Type" the CRM cell contains: "GCRA deadline maintained. GEAA extended 45 days automatic. Institution notifies GEAA within 5 business days citing CRM-TEMP-001. GEAA suspends enforcement. No penalties. If court-ordered GEAA deadline: court order exception per ROD Section 3.1 applies, institution complies with court order for specific proceeding only."

This level of operational specificity is what institutions need. Principles are necessary but insufficient â€” institutions operate through procedures, not principles. A compliance officer can execute a CRM resolution without understanding conflict-of-laws theory, hierarchical governance philosophy, or constitutional meta-law. She looks up the conflict, follows the steps, and the conflict is resolved. That's the entire point.

The Consistency Problem: If 500 institutions face the same GCRA-versus-GEAA temporal conflict, and each independently applies ROD principles, 500 compliance teams produce 500 slightly different resolutions. Some extend GEAA by 30 days, others by 60. Some notify formally, others informally. Some document comprehensively, others minimally. This inconsistency undermines MW's core property â€” determinism.

CRM ensures all 500 institutions facing the same conflict receive identical resolution with identical implementation steps, notification requirements, and timelines. Compliance officers don't interpret or exercise judgment â€” they look up the conflict, receive the answer, and execute it. Identical inputs produce identical outputs applied to conflict resolution itself.

The Speed Problem: Conflict resolution under ROD requires analysis â€” identifying tier and priority, applying resolution principles, determining implementation, and documenting outcomes. For a well-trained team: 1-2 weeks. For a less experienced team: a month. During that analysis period, the institution faces compliance uncertainty â€” potentially violating both authorities while trying to determine which to prioritize.

CRM reduces resolution from weeks to seconds. Input parameters, receive instant resolution, begin execution immediately. No analysis period, no uncertainty, no inadvertent dual violation. Simple conflicts resolve instantaneously through automated lookup. Complex conflicts with unusual context resolve within 24 hours. Genuinely novel conflicts (no matching cell) receive interim resolution within 7-10 days.

The Precedent Accumulation Problem: Without CRM, each resolution exists only in individual institutional records. Institution A resolves a conflict in 2025; Institution B faces the same conflict in 2027 but cannot access A's resolution, independently deriving its own â€” potentially different â€” conclusion. Over time, contradictory precedents accumulate where identical conflicts resolve differently.

CRM creates a single authoritative public resolution for every conflict type. Once integrated into the matrix, every future instance receives the same resolution. The matrix grows as novel conflicts are resolved, building comprehensive deterministic precedent eliminating inconsistency. By year five of MW operation, the matrix should contain resolutions for every conflict combination any institution has ever encountered â€” making even the most unusual conflicts resolvable through simple lookup.

The Institutional Confidence Problem: An institution considering MW certification needs to know not just that conflicts will be resolved, but how they will be resolved. "Trust us, we'll figure it out when conflicts arise" is not an adequate answer for an institution investing $1M+ in MW certification. The institution needs to see the resolution in advance â€” before committing resources â€” so it can assess whether the MW conflict resolution framework produces outcomes the institution can live with.

CRM provides this advance visibility. A prospective institution can query the matrix with hypothetical conflicts ("what happens if GCRA and GEAA deadlines collide?"), see the exact resolution it would receive, and make its certification decision with full information. This transparency converts conflict resolution from a risk factor into a predictable cost â€” which is exactly what institutions need for investment decisions.

III. MATRIX STRUCTURE

3.1 Authority Pair Resolution Tables

The authority pair matrix provides explicit resolution for every combination of conflicting authorities. The following tables document the most operationally significant pairs â€” those most likely to generate institutional conflicts based on overlapping jurisdictional scope and complementary certification requirements.

Tier One Ã— Tier One Conflicts:

GCRA (Doc 32) vs. IRUA (Doc 7): GCRA capital determinism supersedes IRUA institutional reliance flexibility. Rationale: capital infrastructure integrity is the foundation on which reliance networks operate â€” if capital systems aren't deterministic, institutional reliance on those systems is misplaced regardless of IRUA network protections. Implementation: institution maintains GCRA-compliant capital systems; IRUA adjusts reliance verification to accommodate GCRA architecture requirements.

GCRA vs. GEAA (Doc 8): GCRA capital standards supersede GEAA evidence methodology where capital is implicated. Rationale: evidence presentation serves legal proceedings, but capital system integrity serves ongoing institutional operations affecting all counterparties. Implementation: institution designs capital systems to GCRA specifications; evidence presentation of capital operations follows GCRA's audit trail format rather than GEAA's preferred format.

GCRA vs. GCPA (Doc 10): GCRA certification requirements supersede GCPA portfolio evaluation methodology. Rationale: GCRA determines whether a capital system is certified; GCPA evaluates the capital outcomes â€” certification (existence) takes priority over evaluation (measurement).

IRUA vs. GEAA: IRUA reliance protection supersedes GEAA evidence formality requirements. Rationale: reliance networks depend on operational trust between institutions; evidence formality serves judicial proceedings â€” operational trust enables ongoing commerce while judicial proceedings address disputes.

IRUA vs. CivicHab (Doc 9): Institutional reliance obligations supersede spatial governance preferences. GEAA vs. GCPA: Evidence integrity supersedes capital evaluation methodology.

Tier One Ã— Tier Two Conflicts: Every Tier One authority supersedes every Tier Two authority unconditionally. This is not a case-by-case determination â€” it is a structural rule. GCRA supersedes EWA, EPA, EFAA, UPDIUD, and SICA in all circumstances. IRUA supersedes all Tier Two. GEAA supersedes all Tier Two. The rationale is simple: Tier One authorities govern fundamental institutional capabilities (capital infrastructure, reliance networks, evidentiary integrity) while Tier Two authorities govern domain-specific activities that depend on those fundamental capabilities.

Tier Two Ã— Tier Two Conflicts:

EWA (Doc 12) vs. EPA (Doc 13): Eternal works creation supersedes publishing distribution schedules. Rationale: creating the work must precede distributing it â€” production constraints logically dominate distribution preferences.

EWA vs. EFAA (Doc 14): Works production supersedes aesthetic production standards. Rationale: completing the work takes priority over optimizing its aesthetic qualities â€” a completed work with imperfect aesthetics has more value than an aesthetically perfect work that never completes.

EPA vs. EFAA: Publishing distribution supersedes aesthetic production for publication-focused conflicts.

UPDIUD (Doc 15) vs. SICA (Doc 16): Data infrastructure requirements supersede certification process preferences. Rationale: data infrastructure is the substrate on which certification processes execute â€” infrastructure requirements enable process requirements, not the reverse.

Tier Three Ã— Tier Three Conflicts:

IATA (Doc 17) vs. DRFA (Doc 18): Arbitration architecture supersedes finality mechanics. Rationale: the system for resolving disputes must exist before dispute outcomes can be declared final.

CRTA (Doc 19) vs. IPPA (Doc 20): Continuity protection supersedes IP permanence formalities. Rationale: organizational survival enables all other functions including IP protection.

CSCA (Doc 21) vs. DCPA (Doc 22): Succession continuity supersedes data custody in transition scenarios â€” ensuring the organizational successor exists takes priority over ensuring data custody is maintained, because without a successor entity, data custody has no institutional owner.

DCPA vs. FAPA (Doc 23): Data preservation supersedes failure protocol efficiency. Rationale: preserving data enables future recovery regardless of the failure protocol; efficient failure handling without data preservation produces irrecoverable loss.

Cross-tier universal rule: Any Tier One supersedes any Tier Two or Three. Any Tier Two supersedes any Tier Three. No balancing, no exceptions, no contextual modification.

3.2 Conflict Type Resolution Algorithms

Type 1 â€” Temporal Conflicts (simultaneous deadline impossibilities): Algorithm: (1) Identify all conflicting deadlines and associated authorities. (2) Rank by ROD tier and within-tier priority. (3) Extend lower-priority deadlines by the duration required for higher-priority compliance plus a 15-day buffer. (4) Calculate cascading extensions accounting for sequential dependencies â€” if GEAA compliance depends on GCRA system modifications, GEAA's extended deadline starts after GCRA completion, not from the original conflict date. (5) Issue revised deadline schedule to all affected authorities and institutions.

Worked Example: GCRA annual recertification due March 31. GEAA evidence audit due March 31. UPDIUD data infrastructure review due March 31. Resolution: GCRA maintains March 31 (Tier One, Priority 1). GEAA extended to May 15 (+45 days â€” Tier One but lower priority). UPDIUD extended to June 30 (+90 days â€” Tier Two, subordinate to both Tier One deadlines). All extensions automatic upon CRM consultation â€” no negotiation, no approval process.

Type 2 â€” Resource Conflicts (combined demands exceed capacity): Algorithm: (1) Quantify total resource demand across all conflicting requirements. (2) Assess institutional capacity through verified financial and technical data. (3) Allocate resources per hierarchy â€” highest-priority authority receives full allocation first. (4) Authorize phased implementation for lower-priority requirements that cannot be funded in the current period. (5) Establish monitoring ensuring progressive achievement over the phased timeline.

Worked Example: Institution has $500K annual compliance budget. GCRA demands $300K, IRUA demands $200K, CivicHab demands $150K. Total $650K exceeds capacity by $150K. Resolution: GCRA receives $300K (Priority 1). IRUA receives $200K (Priority 2). CivicHab receives phased $150K over two years ($75K year 1, $75K year 2). CivicHab cannot penalize the institution for phased compliance because the phasing is CRM-mandated.

Type 3 â€” Substantive Conflicts (contradictory mandates): Algorithm: (1) Identify specific contradictory mandates with precise requirement text. (2) Determine authority tier and within-tier priority. (3) Declare higher-priority requirement binding; suspend lower-priority requirement for the specific conflict scope. (4) Notify subordinated authority â€” the authority must modify its requirement to eliminate the conflict for future cases. (5) Grant institution complete safe harbor for non-compliance with the subordinated requirement.

Worked Example: GCRA requires deterministic capital allocation without human override. A new Tier Two authority requires discretionary management review for all automated decisions. Resolution: GCRA binding (Tier One supersedes Tier Two unconditionally). Institution implements deterministic system. Tier Two authority's discretionary review requirement suspended for GCRA-certified capital systems. Tier Two authority must modify its requirement to exclude GCRA-certified systems.

Type 4 â€” Technical Conflicts (mutually incompatible specifications): Algorithm: (1) Document specific incompatibilities. (2) Assess modification cost for each specification. (3) Higher-priority specification prevails; if equal tier, lower-modification-cost specification prevails. (4) If both modifications are prohibitively expensive, authorize alternative compliance methodology. (5) Establish technical working group to develop harmonized specification.

Type 5 â€” Jurisdictional Conflicts (overlapping authority claims): Algorithm: (1) Map activity to authority scope definitions from canonical charters. (2) Most specific jurisdiction claim prevails â€” the authority whose charter most specifically addresses the exact activity in question. (3) Secondary authorities receive consultative role (input on policy, no enforcement authority). (4) Coordination protocol for ongoing oversight prevents future overlap.

3.3 Severity Scaling (10 Levels)

Levels 1-2 (Minimal Impact): Minor compliance complexity increase affecting fewer than 10% of institutions. Resolution through clarification guidance. No deadline extensions or burden relief needed. Resolved through standard Committee workflow.

Levels 3-4 (Low Impact): Moderate compliance effort increase affecting 10-25% of institutions. Resolution through minor requirement modification. Deadline extensions up to 30 days.

Levels 5-6 (Moderate Impact): Substantial burden increase affecting 25-50% of institutions. Requires significant requirement harmonization. Deadline extensions up to 90 days. CACAP notification triggered.

Levels 7-8 (High Impact): Major compliance challenge affecting 50-75% of institutions. Requires authority requirement restructuring. Deadline extensions up to 180 days. Emergency Committee session if escalation needed.

Levels 9-10 (Critical Impact): Impossible compliance threatening ecosystem viability. Over 75% of institutions affected. Requires fundamental framework modification. Indefinite deadline suspension until resolution achieved. Constitutional override pathway (Document 35 Section 6.4) available.

3.4 Context Variables (20 Categories)

Financial: institutional size (AUM tier), profitability, compliance budget percentage, capital market access. Technical: infrastructure maturity, staff expertise, integration complexity, vendor ecosystem. Temporal: time since certification, pending M&A, regulatory exam schedule, fiscal cycle. Jurisdictional: primary jurisdiction, multi-jurisdictional complexity, data transfer restrictions, local law conflicts. Institutional: public/private, for-profit/non-profit, governmental/commercial, systemic importance.

Context variables trigger conditional resolutions modifying implementation pathway â€” not hierarchy. A $100M community bank and a $1T systemically important institution receive the same hierarchical resolution (GCRA outranks GEAA) but may receive different implementation timelines (the community bank gets 90 days, the SIFI gets 30 days because it has larger compliance staff). The hierarchy is immutable; the implementation is contextual.

IV. RESOLUTION EXECUTION

4.1 Conflict Identification

Institutions systematically identify conflicts requiring CRM resolution through three channels:

Active Monitoring: Quarterly compliance calendar review identifying deadline clusters where multiple authority obligations converge within the same window. Annual budget planning revealing resource allocation conflicts where combined compliance costs exceed available budget. System architecture planning detecting technical incompatibilities when infrastructure upgrades for one authority would break compliance with another. Regulatory change monitoring flagging new or modified national regulations that conflict with existing MW obligations.

Automated Detection: Institutional compliance management systems automatically flag contradictory requirements when new authority updates are published. Calendar systems alert to simultaneous deadlines from different authorities. Budget systems identify funding shortfalls when projected compliance costs exceed allocation. Technical monitoring systems detect when system modifications for one authority create incompatibilities with another authority's specifications.

External Notification: Authority-published alerts identifying known conflicts (from CACAP scanning per Document 35). Peer institution warnings shared through industry groups and professional associations. Consultant identification during periodic compliance assessments. Auditor findings during certification reviews revealing non-compliance caused by previously unidentified conflicts.

Conflict Documentation: Institutions must document conflicts with precision sufficient for accurate CRM lookup: precise identification of conflicting authorities (by document number and section); specific requirement text creating the contradiction (quoted verbatim); quantification of impossibility (temporal: deadline gap analysis; resource: budget shortfall calculation; technical: incompatibility specification; substantive: logical contradiction statement); and applicable context variables from the 20-category checklist. Documentation quality directly determines CRM resolution accuracy â€” imprecise or incomplete documentation may return an incorrect or suboptimal resolution.

4.2 Matrix Consultation (5-Step Process)

Step 1 â€” Access CRM Interface: Web-based lookup tool provides the primary institutional interface. REST API enables automated integration with institutional compliance management systems (IFTTT-style triggers when new conflicts are detected). Command-line interface available for technical users and scripting. Mobile application for field compliance officers requiring on-the-go access. All interfaces return identical resolutions â€” the access method is a convenience choice, not a resolution factor.

Step 2 â€” Input Conflict Parameters: Select conflicting authorities from structured menus (organized by tier for easy navigation). Choose conflict type from the 5-category classification. Provide severity self-assessment with supporting data (the system validates the self-assessment against objective criteria and may adjust). Input applicable context variables from the standardized checklist â€” each variable is binary (applies / does not apply) eliminating subjective assessment.

Step 3 â€” Receive Resolution: Automated matrix lookup retrieves the applicable resolution within milliseconds for standard conflicts. Display includes: primary resolution with narrative explanation; conditional resolutions triggered by specific context variable combinations; step-by-step implementation guidance with specific actions, notifications, and timelines; appeal pathway if the institution believes the resolution contains factual errors; and precedent references showing how identical conflicts were previously resolved.

Step 4 â€” Document Resolution Selection: Download resolution certificate with unique identifier (CRM-RES-[YYYY]-[NNNNN]-[AUTHORITY-A]-[AUTHORITY-B]). Certificate includes SHA3-512 hash of the resolution parameters ensuring no post-hoc modification. Save to institution's compliance management system and distribute to all affected personnel. Archive for audit and verification â€” resolution certificates are retained permanently as part of the institution's compliance record per Document 27 chain-of-custody requirements.

Step 5 â€” Execute Resolution: Follow implementation guidance precisely â€” deviations from CRM-specified steps may invalidate safe harbor protection. Notify subordinated authorities within specified timelines using provided templates. Request deadline extensions or burden relief as specified in the resolution. Monitor compliance with the prevailing requirement and report progress per the monitoring schedule included in the resolution.

Response Time Standards: Simple conflicts (standard authority pair, common conflict type, typical context): instant automated resolution, sub-second response. Complex conflicts (unusual context variable combinations, high severity, multiple simultaneous conflicts): within 24 hours including manual review by Committee staff to verify automated resolution applicability. Novel conflicts (no matching matrix cell): within 7 days including Committee evaluation, interim resolution development, and stakeholder consultation per Section VI.

4.3 Implementation Guidance

Each CRM resolution includes comprehensive implementation instructions structured in five categories:

Required Actions: Specific steps the institution must take, in sequence, with timeline. Documentation requirements for demonstrating compliance with the prevailing requirement and CRM-mandated non-compliance with the subordinated requirement. Notification obligations to prevailing authority (confirmation of compliance approach), subordinated authority (conflict notification with CRM citation), and any secondary authorities affected by the resolution. Timeline for each action with firm deadlines â€” not "as soon as practicable" but "within 5 business days."

Prohibited Actions: Conduct the institution must avoid during resolution implementation â€” for example, the institution must not simultaneously attempt compliance with both conflicting requirements (which would waste resources and potentially produce a compromise that satisfies neither). Compliance efforts the institution should suspend pending resolution (not abandon permanently, but pause until the resolution pathway is clear). Expenditures to defer pending resolution outcome. Communications to avoid â€” for example, the institution should not publicly disclose the conflict until the CRM resolution is issued, preventing market confusion.

Authority Notifications: Pre-drafted template communications for the prevailing authority (confirming the institution's compliance approach, requesting any accommodations specified in the resolution). Pre-drafted template notifications for the subordinated authority (citing the specific CRM resolution by identifier, providing the conflict documentation, and requesting formal acknowledgment). Timeline for notification delivery (typically 5 business days for standard conflicts, 48 hours for high-severity). Required authority acknowledgment procedures â€” the subordinated authority must formally acknowledge receipt within 10 business days or the CRM system automatically escalates.

Safe Harbor Documentation: Evidence the institution must maintain to demonstrate CRM reliance in any future enforcement action. Retention requirements: permanent per Document 27 chain-of-custody standards. Audit trail specifications: the institution must demonstrate that it consulted CRM, received the resolution, and executed the specified steps in order. Compliance certification templates for the institution's internal records and for external auditors.

Monitoring Requirements: Progress reporting obligations during phased implementation (monthly reports for low severity, weekly for high severity, daily for critical). Milestone achievement verification with specific measurable indicators. Ongoing compliance confirmation after resolution implementation. Resolution effectiveness assessment at 90 days and 180 days to ensure the resolution actually eliminated the conflict rather than merely deferring it.

4.4 Appeal Mechanisms

Permissible grounds: factual errors in conflict characterization (the CRM identified the wrong authorities or the wrong conflict type); incorrect authority tier or priority assignment (the resolution applied the wrong ROD hierarchy position); misapplication of context variables (a context variable was included or excluded incorrectly); technical errors in the matrix lookup algorithm (software bug producing wrong cell); and changed circumstances rendering the resolution obsolete (an authority modified its requirement after the CRM resolution was issued).

Prohibited grounds: disagreement with ROD hierarchy principles (GCRA outranks GEAA â€” this is not appealable); preference for a different resolution approach; burden complaints about the prevailing requirement (the institution dislikes the resolution outcome); political or policy objections; and desire for case-by-case discretionary treatment.

Process: Days 1-7 (appeal filing with specific factual errors identified, supporting evidence, proposed correction if applicable, $5,000 filing fee refunded if successful). Days 8-14 (automated permissibility screening â€” prohibited appeals dismissed with explanation; permissible appeals assigned to review panel; affected authorities notified). Days 15-21 (evidence collection from institution, authorities, and independent experts as needed). Days 22-28 (panel analysis, deliberation, and written decision â€” affirm, modify, or reverse with detailed reasoning).

Appeal outcomes: resolution affirmed (original remains binding, appeal fee forfeited); resolution modified (corrected resolution with immediate effect, appeal fee refunded); resolution reversed (new resolution replacing original, appeal fee refunded, institution receives compliance credit for identifying the error).

V. AUTHORITY INTERACTION PROTOCOLS

5.1 Prevailing Authority Obligations

Clear communication: unambiguous specifications, prompt clarification, implementation guidance, accessible support. Reasonable accommodation: grant extensions for conflict-caused delays, accept alternative methodologies, work with institutions on compliance solutions, avoid enforcement during good-faith efforts. Burden awareness: acknowledge constraints, minimize costs, coordinate with other authorities, report feedback. Documentation support: compliance certification, extension acknowledgment letters, audit verification, safe harbor record support.

5.2 Subordinated Authority Obligations

Enforcement suspension: immediately suspend enforcement, withdraw prior penalties, cease monitoring, cancel scheduled audits. Deadline extensions: automatically extend per CRM, issue formal confirmations, adjust calendars, coordinate future deadlines. Requirement modification: review for harmonization, propose conflict-eliminating modifications, coordinate with prevailing authority. Documentation cooperation: acknowledge CRM determination, provide non-compliance waivers, confirm good-faith efforts.

Prohibition on retaliation: cannot penalize CRM-based non-compliance; cannot condition services on subordinated compliance; cannot create alternative circumventing requirements; cannot encourage CRM violation. Retaliation constitutes material violation triggering the subordinated authority's own review under CACAP.

5.3 Joint Authority Responsibilities

Conflict resolution cooperation: harmonization participation, technical expertise, compromise acceptance, good-faith implementation. Institutional communication coordination: unified messaging, no contradictory guidance, joint publications, consistent responses. Future prevention: root cause analysis, process modification, CACAP implementation, lessons shared. Data sharing: conflict statistics, burden feedback, technical specifications, CRM improvement contributions.

5.4 Authority Dispute Resolution

Permissible: CRM contradicts ROD, resolution creates constitutional violations, technical impossibility, systemic pattern. Prohibited: disagreement with priority ranking, preference for subordinated requirement, desire for discretion. Process: formal filing â†’ Committee analysis â†’ determination (affirm/modify/reverse) â†’ implementation. Corrected resolutions issue with immediate effect. Matrix updated. Precedent established.

VI. NOVEL CONFLICT HANDLING

6.1 Novel Conflict Identification

Criteria: new authority combinations; unprecedented conflict types (hybrid, technologically emergent); unique context combinations (extreme severity, novel institutional characteristics); systemic conflicts affecting entire categories. Detection: automated lookup returns no match; multiple institutions report identical unresolved conflict; authority requests guidance; Committee identifies coverage gap.

6.2 Interim Resolution (10-Day Procedure)

Days 1-3: Expedited analysis â€” characterization, closest analogous precedent, ROD principle application, burden minimization. Days 4-5: Draft resolution â€” preliminary specification, implementation guidance, impact projection. Days 6-7: Stakeholder review â€” institutional consultation, authority input, expert review. Days 8-10: Issuance â€” publication, distribution, coordination, monitoring establishment.

Interim characteristics: temporary with 6-month sunset; subject to refinement; conservative (favoring institutional protection); automatic review for permanent integration.

6.3 Permanent Integration (6-Month Process)

Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Monitor implementation â€” track experiences, collect feedback, identify consequences. Phase 2 (Months 4-5): Refine resolution â€” analyze data, modify addressing issues, develop comprehensive guidance, pilot test. Phase 3 (Month 6): Permanent integration â€” finalize specification, update matrix, publish documentation, train users. Phase 4 (Ongoing): Precedent establishment â€” document as precedent, identify applicable principles, recommend CACAP modifications, contribute to design standard evolution.

Committee approval required with stakeholder consultation and constitutional compliance verification.

6.4 Emergency Novel Conflicts

Criteria: immediate certification loss risk, systemic stability threat, imminent regulatory enforcement, critical system failure. Accelerated: Day 1 (escalation), Day 2 (emergency analysis), Day 3 (interim resolution with immediate effect), Days 4-30 (monitoring and refinement), Day 31 (permanent integration). Safeguards: enhanced post-implementation review, 90-day sunset unless reaffirmed, abuse penalties.
