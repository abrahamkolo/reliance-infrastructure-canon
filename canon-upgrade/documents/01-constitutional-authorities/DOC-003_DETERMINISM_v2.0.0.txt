I. IDENTITY & CLASSIFICATION

A. Name
Determinism & Run-Only Enforcement Law

B. Authority Type
Layer-0 System Charter (MW Governance Kernel)

C. Jurisdiction
Universal (applies to all MW authorities, all jurisdictions, all time periods)

D. Operational Status
LOCKED & IMMORTAL

This law operates in run-only mode. No amendments, interpretations, exceptions, or modifications are permitted. Determinism is absolute.

E. Purpose Statement
This law establishes the absolute requirement for deterministic execution across all MW authorities and prohibits all forms of discretionary modification, interpretation, or customization post-canonical status. It ensures institutional reliance by guaranteeing identical outputs from identical inputs regardless of time, operator, jurisdiction, or external conditions.

________________


II. DETERMINISM: DEFINITION & REQUIREMENTS

A. Core Definition

Determinism = A process where identical inputs ALWAYS produce identical outputs, regardless of:
* Time of execution (2025 vs. 2075)
* Geographic location (New York vs. Singapore)
* Operator identity (Goldman Sachs vs. local credit union)
* External market conditions (bull market vs. recession)
* Political environment (friendly regime vs. hostile regime)
* Institutional popularity (widely adopted vs. zero adoption)

Mathematical expression:
For all inputs I, times Tâ‚ and Tâ‚‚, operators Oâ‚ and Oâ‚‚, jurisdictions Jâ‚ and Jâ‚‚:
If I(Tâ‚, Oâ‚, Jâ‚) = I(Tâ‚‚, Oâ‚‚, Jâ‚‚)
Then Output(I, Tâ‚, Oâ‚, Jâ‚) â‰¡ Output(I, Tâ‚‚, Oâ‚‚, Jâ‚‚)  [bit-for-bit identical]


B. Non-Negotiable Determinism Requirements

All MW authorities MUST exhibit determinism in:

1. Input Validation
* Accept/reject criteria must be exhaustively specified
* No "reasonable discretion" permitted
* No "case-by-case basis" permitted
* Binary decision: input is valid OR invalid (no "maybe")

Example of deterministic input validation:
Input: Transaction ID format
Requirement: Exactly 12 alphanumeric characters, starting with "TX"
Valid: TX12AB34CD56
Invalid: TX12AB (too short), 12AB34CD56EF (too long), AB12CD34EF56 (wrong prefix)


Example of non-deterministic input validation:
Input: Transaction seems legitimate
Requirement: Operator judges legitimacy based on experience
Result: Different operators reach different conclusions


2. Decision Trees
* Branching logic must cover ALL possible input states
* No "unforeseen circumstances" branches
* No "at the discretion of the operator" endpoints
* Every decision path must terminate in deterministic output

Example of deterministic decision tree:
IF transaction_amount > $1,000,000 THEN require_additional_verification = TRUE
ELSE require_additional_verification = FALSE


Example of non-deterministic decision tree:
IF transaction_amount seems high THEN maybe require verification


3. Output Formatting
* Structure must be standardized (JSON, XML, fixed-format text)
* Precision must be specified (2 decimal places, ISO 8601 timestamps)
* No "customize for client preference"
* No "round to nearest convenient unit"

Example of deterministic output:
{
  "certification_id": "IRUA-2025-001234",
  "status": "IRREVERSIBLE",
  "timestamp": "2025-02-01T14:30:00.000Z",
  "hash": "a3f5b2..."
}


Example of non-deterministic output:
Status: Irreversible (probably)
Time: Around 2:30 PM


4. Timestamp Generation
* ISO 8601 standard mandatory
* UTC timezone mandatory (no local timezone conversion)
* Millisecond precision minimum
* No "approximate timestamps"

5. Hash Calculation
* SHA-256 or cryptographically stronger
* No algorithm substitution based on "performance optimization"
* Same input document = same hash ALWAYS

6. Version Tracking
* Semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
* No ad-hoc version schemes ("Spring 2025 Edition," "Updated Version")
* Version increments follow deterministic rules

________________


III. RUN-ONLY LAW: ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION ON MODIFICATION

A. Core Statement

Once a document achieves canonical status, it executes in run-only mode.

"Run-only" means:
* NO modifications (not even typo corrections)
* NO interpretations (text means what it says, period)
* NO customizations (universal application or rejection)
* NO emergency suspensions (crises activate deterministic protocols, not overrides)
* NO founder updates (founder cannot revise post-deployment)

B. Prohibited Modification Types

1. Textual Modification
* Cannot fix typos or grammatical errors
* Cannot clarify ambiguous language
* Cannot add missing sections
* Cannot remove obsolete sections
* Cannot reorder content for clarity

Rationale: Even "obvious corrections" introduce discretion. Who decides what's "obvious"? What's an "improvement" vs. "substantive change"? The only defense against modification drift is absolute prohibition.

2. Interpretive Clarification
* Cannot issue "official interpretations"
* Cannot publish "guidance documents" explaining canonical meaning
* Cannot create "FAQ" that expands on canonical text
* Cannot testify in court about "what we really meant"

Rationale: Interpretation = modification by another name. If canonical text is ambiguous, it remains ambiguous. Institutions must rely on text as written, not on "clarifications."

3. Scope Expansion
* Cannot expand authority jurisdiction
* Cannot add new domains to charter
* Cannot claim "related" topics fall under authority
* Cannot absorb adjacent authorities

Rationale: Covered by Non-Escalation Principle (Document 2), but reinforced here because scope expansion is form of modification.

4. Scope Reduction
* Cannot narrow charter boundaries
* Cannot declare portions of charter "obsolete"
* Cannot selectively decline to enforce charter sections

Rationale: Scope reduction = modification. Authorities must execute entire charter or cease operationâ€”no selective compliance.

5. Emergency Exceptions
* Cannot suspend operations "temporarily"
* Cannot create "crisis protocols" that override canonical rules
* Cannot grant founder emergency authority

Rationale: Emergency Continuity Law (MW Canon, Law 8) defines deterministic emergency protocols. No additional emergency authority permitted.

6. Versioning Loopholes
* Cannot call modification a "version 1.1" and claim it's not really modification
* Cannot issue "patches" or "hotfixes"
* Cannot create "supplemental documents" that effectively modify canonical text

Rationale: Version number changes do not exempt modifications from prohibition. MW Canon v1.0 has no v1.1, v2.0, or any subsequent version.

C. Permitted Actions Under Run-Only Law

1. Execution
* Authorities may execute canonical protocols as written
* Valid queries trigger deterministic responses
* No execution = silence (which is valid state per Silence Validity Law)

2. Observation
* Institutions may observe authority behavior
* Verifiers may test determinism
* Auditors may confirm compliance

3. Abandonment
* Institutions may stop using MW authorities
* No penalty for abandonment
* Dormancy is valid operational state

4. Independent Deployment
* If MW-1 becomes obsolete, institutions may deploy MW-2 as separate system
* MW-1 and MW-2 are independent (no migration, no compatibility requirement)

IV. DETERMINISM VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

A. Test Procedure

Objective: Confirm authority produces identical outputs from identical inputs.

Steps:
1. Select test input: Choose representative query/request
2. First execution (Tâ‚€): Submit input to authority, record output Oâ‚, record timestamp, jurisdiction, operator
3. Second execution (Tâ‚): Submit identical input at different time/location/operator, record output Oâ‚‚
4. Comparison: Compare Oâ‚ and Oâ‚‚ bit-for-bit
5. Result: If Oâ‚ â‰¡ Oâ‚‚ (exactly identical) â†’ PASS. If Oâ‚ â‰  Oâ‚‚ (any difference) â†’ FAIL.

Pass criteria: 100% output identity across minimum 1,000 trials.

Failure consequence: Authority fails canonical verification immediately. No partial credit. No "deterministic enough." Authority returns to development or is permanently excluded.

B. Test Coverage Requirements

Verification must test across:

1. Temporal Variation
* Execute same input at multiple times (morning, afternoon, night)
* Execute across multiple days
* Execute across multiple years (if authority has operated long enough)

2. Geographic Variation
* Execute from multiple jurisdictions (US, EU, Asia minimum)
* Execute from multiple network locations
* Execute with different timezone settings (should not affect output if UTC enforced)

3. Operator Variation
* Execute with different institutional operators (bank, insurance company, trust, court)
* Execute with different user accounts
* Execute with different authentication credentials

4. External Condition Variation
* Execute during market volatility vs. stability
* Execute during regulatory changes vs. stability
* Execute during high vs. low institutional adoption

5. Edge Case Coverage
* Execute with boundary values (maximum allowed input, minimum allowed input)
* Execute with malformed inputs (should reject deterministically)
* Execute with previously unseen inputs (should process according to rules)

C. Verification Frequency

Continuous verification: Authorities should be tested continuously, not just at initial deployment.

Minimum verification schedule:
* Quarterly: Random sample of 100 queries tested for determinism
* Annually: Comprehensive test of 1,000+ queries across all conditions
* Post-incident: If any non-determinism suspected, immediate full verification

Verifier independence: Must be performed by independent third parties with no financial interest in MW adoption (same qualified verifiers as specified in Document 2, Section XI-B).

D. Public Verification Results

All verification results must be:
* Published within 7 days of test completion
* Accessible without authentication (public read access)
* Retained permanently (no deletion permitted)
* Cryptographically signed by verifier

Result format:
```
DETERMINISM VERIFICATION REPORT
Authority: [Name]
Test Date: [ISO 8601]
Verifier: [Organization + credentials]
Trial Count: [Integer, minimum 1000]
Pass Rate: [Percentage, 100.00% required]
Failed Trials: [Count, 0 required for PASS]
Overall Result: [PASS / FAIL]
[If FAIL: specific trial IDs where non-determinism detected]
```

V. NON-DETERMINISM CONSEQUENCES

A. Authority-Level Consequences

If authority exhibits non-determinism:

**Immediate consequence**: Authority loses canonical status
**Retroactive effect**: All determinations issued by authority become void
**No cure period**: Unlike layer violations (Document 2), non-determinism has no cure mechanism
**Permanent exclusion**: Authority cannot be restored

Rationale: Determinism is binary (100% or nothing). There is no "mostly deterministic" or "deterministic except for this one bug." Non-determinism destroys institutional reliance completely. Harsh consequences protect institutions.

B. Institutional Risk Allocation

Institutions relying on non-deterministic authority bear the risk.

MW does not provide:
* Refunds for fees paid
* Damages for reliance losses
* Make-whole remedies

Rationale: Institutions are sophisticated actors. They can verify determinism before relying. They can monitor ongoing determinism. They choose to rely at their own risk.

Protection for institutions: Public verification results, audit trails, and continuous monitoring provide tools for institutions to assess determinism risk before relying.

C. Verifier Liability

Verifiers who certify non-deterministic authority as deterministic:

**Civil liability**: Institutions may sue verifier for reliance losses
**Professional sanctions**: Loss of verifier credentials (Document 2, Section XI-B)
**Exclusion from future verification**: Removed from qualified verifier pool permanently

Rationale: Verifiers have critical institutional trust role. False certification of determinism creates systemic risk. Verifier accountability protects institutional ecosystem.

VI. PERMITTED NON-DETERMINISM (NARROW EXCEPTIONS)

A. Cryptographic Nonce Generation

Exception: Cryptographic security requires unpredictable random numbers (nonces, initialization vectors, salts).

Permitted: Authorities may use cryptographically secure random number generation for security purposes only.

Constraint: Randomness must be:
* Limited to cryptographic security functions
* Not used for decision-making
* Not used for output generation beyond security parameters

Example of permitted randomness:
Generate random nonce for authentication challenge
Use random salt for password hashing


Example of prohibited randomness:
Randomly select which of two valid outputs to return
Introduce random delay in response time for "fairness"


B. Human Query Formulation

Exception: Humans formulate queries in natural language with variations.

Permitted: Humans may ask same question different ways.

Constraint: Authority must normalize queries to deterministic internal representation before processing.

Example:
Query 1: "Is Transaction TX123456 irreversible?"
Query 2: "Determine irreversibility status for TX123456"
Query 3: "TX123456 - irreversible?"


Authority normalizes all three to: check_irreversibility(transaction_id="TX123456")
All three produce identical output.


C. Geographic Distribution Selection

Exception: MW authorities operate in multiple jurisdictions for redundancy.

Permitted: Which specific jurisdiction hosts authority instance is operationally irrelevant.

Constraint: Output must be identical regardless of which jurisdiction processes query.

Example:
Query submitted to Delaware instance: Output Oâ‚
Identical query submitted to Singapore instance: Output Oâ‚‚
Requirement: Oâ‚ â‰¡ Oâ‚‚ (bit-for-bit identical)


Rationale: Geographic distribution is infrastructure optimization, not decision-making variable. Jurisdiction selection does not affect output.

D. Timestamp Precision Beyond Milliseconds

Exception: Timestamp precision may exceed specified minimum (milliseconds) for technical reasons.

Permitted: Timestamps may include microseconds or nanoseconds if technically available.

Constraint: Authority must specify precision in charter. If charter specifies millisecond precision but infrastructure provides nanoseconds, authority may:
* Report nanosecond precision (higher accuracy acceptable)
* Round to milliseconds deterministically (same rounding algorithm always)

Not permitted: Vary precision based on query characteristics or operator preference.

VII. INPUT-OUTPUT SPECIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

A. Input Specification

All authorities must specify:

1. Input Format
* Data type (string, integer, boolean, timestamp, etc.)
* Structure (JSON schema, XML schema, fixed-format specification)
* Character encoding (UTF-8 mandatory)
* Maximum length/size constraints

2. Input Domain
* Valid value ranges (e.g., integers 1-999, strings 1-100 characters)
* Enumerated options (e.g., status must be "ACTIVE" or "INACTIVE")
* Format constraints (e.g., timestamps must be ISO 8601)

3. Input Validation Rules
* Required fields vs. optional fields
* Conditional requirements (if field A present, field B required)
* Cross-field validation (e.g., end_date must be after start_date)

4. Rejection Criteria
* Exhaustive list of rejection reasons
* Each rejection reason has deterministic trigger
* No "other" or "miscellaneous" rejection categories

Example of complete input specification:
Input: Irreversibility Certification Request
Required fields:
  - transaction_id: string, exactly 12 alphanumeric characters, starts with "TX"
  - timestamp: ISO 8601 datetime, UTC timezone
  - requesting_institution: string, 1-100 characters
Optional fields:
  - jurisdiction: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code
Rejection criteria:
  - transaction_id wrong format â†’ reject with error code 1001
  - timestamp future date â†’ reject with error code 1002
  - requesting_institution empty â†’ reject with error code 1003


B. Output Specification

All authorities must specify:

1. Output Format
* Data type for each output field
* Structure (consistent across all outputs)
* Character encoding (UTF-8 mandatory)

2. Output Precision
* Decimal places for numeric values (e.g., currency to 2 decimal places)
* Timestamp precision (ISO 8601 with milliseconds minimum)
* Hash length (SHA-256 = 64 hexadecimal characters)

3. Output Completeness
* All required fields specified
* No optional fields (output is deterministic = fully specified)
* No "TBD" or "N/A" fields

4. Output Uniqueness
* Each output must be uniquely identifiable (certification ID, determination ID)
* IDs must be deterministic or securely random (not sequential counters that leak information)

Example of complete output specification:
Output: Irreversibility Certification
{
  "certification_id": "string, format IRUA-YYYY-NNNNNN",
  "transaction_id": "string, copied from input",
  "status": "string, enum [IRREVERSIBLE, REVERSIBLE, INDETERMINATE]",
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 datetime, UTC, millisecond precision",
  "hash": "string, SHA-256 of certification content, 64 hex characters",
  "authority_version": "string, format vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"
}

VIII. BEHAVIORAL DETERMINISM REQUIREMENTS

A. Execution Sequence Determinism

Requirement: Authorities must execute operations in deterministic order.

Prohibited:
* Parallel processing with non-deterministic completion order
* "Process requests as we get to them"
* "Optimize execution order based on load"

Permitted:
* Sequential processing (first-in, first-out)
* Parallel processing IF results are deterministically merged
* Deterministic priority queues (priority calculated deterministically from request parameters)

B. Error Handling Determinism

Requirement: Errors must be handled deterministically.

Prohibited:
* "Retry if server is busy" (non-deterministicâ€”depends on server load)
* "Skip this request and process next one" (non-deterministicâ€”depends on timing)
* "Log error and return generic message" (if logged error content varies)

Permitted:
* "Return error code 5001: Internal processing failure" (deterministic)
* "Reject request with specific error message" (deterministic)
* "Halt processing and require manual intervention" (deterministic)

C. Logging Determinism

Requirement: Logs must not introduce non-determinism in outputs.

Permitted:
* Log all queries and responses
* Log timestamps of operations
* Log system events

Prohibited:
* Modify outputs based on log analysis
* Change behavior based on historical query patterns
* Introduce "smart" optimizations based on logs

________________


IX. TEMPORAL DETERMINISM REQUIREMENTS

A. Time-Independence

Requirement: Output must be independent of execution time (except for timestamps themselves).

Prohibited:
* "Business hours only" processing (output should not depend on whether it's 9 AM or 9 PM)
* "We process faster during off-peak" (speed may vary, output must not)
* "Different rules apply on weekends" (rules are universal)

Permitted:
* Timestamp generation reflects actual execution time
* Sequence numbers reflect actual execution order

Example of time-independent processing:
Query at 2025-02-01 10:00:00 â†’ Output: {..., "timestamp": "2025-02-01T10:00:00.000Z"}
Identical query at 2025-02-01 22:00:00 â†’ Output: {..., "timestamp": "2025-02-01T22:00:00.000Z"}
All fields identical EXCEPT timestamp (which properly reflects execution time)


B. Historical Consistency

Requirement: Authority must produce same output for same query regardless of how much time has passed since deployment.

Test: Query submitted in 2025 should produce identical output (except timestamp) as identical query submitted in 2075.

Prohibited:
* "Updated algorithms" that change outputs
* "Improved accuracy" that modifies behavior
* "Calibration" based on historical data

Permitted:
* Timestamp properly reflects 2025 vs. 2075
* Internal logging shows different execution dates

________________


X. OPERATOR-INDEPENDENCE

A. Operator Neutrality

Requirement: Output must be independent of who submits query.

Prohibited:
* "VIP treatment" for major institutions
* "Enhanced service" for paying customers
* "Penalty" for institutions that previously challenged authority

Permitted:
* Authentication (verify operator is authorized to query)
* Logging (record who queried, for audit purposes only)

Test:
Goldman Sachs submits query Q â†’ Output Oâ‚
Local credit union submits identical query Q â†’ Output Oâ‚‚
Requirement: Oâ‚ â‰¡ Oâ‚‚ (bit-for-bit identical, except operator identification in metadata)


B. Authentication vs. Authorization

Authentication (PERMITTED): Verify that requester is who they claim to be.

Authorization (PERMITTED WITH CONSTRAINTS): Verify that requester is allowed to submit this type of query.

Prohibited authorization: Differential treatment based on requester identity. If two requesters are both authorized, they get identical outputs.

________________


XI. JURISDICTION-INDEPENDENCE

A. Geographic Neutrality

Requirement: Output must be independent of geographic location where query originates or is processed.

Prohibited:
* "Different rules for EU vs. US queries"
* "Enhanced processing for queries from friendly jurisdictions"
* "Modified outputs to comply with local law"

Permitted:
* Metadata noting query origin (for audit purposes only)
* Rejection if query violates authority charter (but rejection is deterministic)

Clarification on legal compliance: If local law prohibits certain MW authority operations, authority may decline to operate in that jurisdiction. But if authority operates, it operates identically everywhere.

________________


XII. EXTERNAL-CONDITION INDEPENDENCE

A. Market-Independence

Requirement: Output must be independent of market conditions.

Prohibited:
* "Adjusted for current market volatility"
* "Different standards during recession vs. boom"
* "Enhanced scrutiny during crisis"

Test:
Query during bull market â†’ Output Oâ‚
Identical query during bear market â†’ Output Oâ‚‚
Requirement: Oâ‚ â‰¡ Oâ‚‚


B. Popularity-Independence

Requirement: Output must be independent of MW adoption rates.

Prohibited:
* "Modified behavior because we're popular now"
* "Stricter standards because we have institutional credibility"
* "Relaxed standards to attract more users"

Rationale: This is core to No-Feedback Law (MW Canon, Law 3). Reinforced here because feedback-based modification is form of non-determinism.

XIII. CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHM MIGRATION PROTOCOL

A. Quantum Resistance Requirement

**Problem**: Current cryptographic algorithms (SHA-256, RSA-2048) vulnerable to quantum computing attacks. Shor's algorithm (quantum) can break RSA. Grover's algorithm reduces SHA-256 effective security to 128-bit (still acceptable but weakened).

**Timeline risk**: Cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) estimated deployment: 2030-2040 (conservative), 2040-2050 (optimistic).

**MW commitment**: 100+ year validity requires quantum-resistant cryptography NOW, not after quantum computers deployed.

**Solution**: Deterministic cryptographic migration protocol.

B. Algorithm Migration Timeline

**Phase 1: Dual-Signing Period** (2025-2030)
- All artifacts signed with BOTH current algorithm (SHA-256) AND quantum-resistant algorithm (CRYSTALS-Dilithium)
- Verification accepts either signature (backward compatibility)
- Institutions encouraged to upgrade verification infrastructure to quantum-resistant

**Phase 2: Transition Period** (2030-2035)
- Quantum-resistant algorithm (CRYSTALS-Dilithium) becomes PRIMARY
- Legacy algorithm (SHA-256) still accepted for backward compatibility
- New artifacts signed ONLY with quantum-resistant algorithm
- Institutions MUST upgrade verification infrastructure (5-year notice provided)

**Phase 3: Quantum-Only Period** (2035+)
- Legacy algorithm (SHA-256) deprecated entirely
- Only quantum-resistant signatures accepted
- Artifacts signed with legacy algorithm before 2035 remain valid (grandfathered), but no NEW legacy signatures accepted

C. Approved Quantum-Resistant Algorithms

**Current approved**: CRYSTALS-Dilithium (NIST PQC standard, lattice-based)

**Contingency approved** (if Dilithium broken):
- SPHINCS+ (hash-based signatures, slower but highly secure)
- FALCON (lattice-based, faster but larger signatures)

**Migration trigger**: If CRYSTALS-Dilithium compromised before Phase 3 completion, immediately switch to SPHINCS+ using same 3-phase timeline.

D. Determinism Preservation During Migration

**Critical constraint**: Algorithm migration must NOT introduce non-determinism.

**Enforcement**:
1. Same artifact content hashed with SHA-256 â†’ Hashâ‚
2. Same artifact content hashed with CRYSTALS-Dilithium â†’ Hashâ‚‚
3. Both hashes recorded in artifact metadata
4. Verification: Check Hashâ‚ OR Hashâ‚‚ (Phase 1-2), check Hashâ‚‚ only (Phase 3)

**Non-determinism test**:
- Artifact A signed in 2025 (dual-signed: SHA-256 + Dilithium)
- Artifact B signed in 2036 (Dilithium only)
- Both artifacts have IDENTICAL content except signature metadata
- Verification in 2036: Both artifacts validate successfully (A via grandfathered SHA-256, B via current Dilithium)
- Determinism preserved: Content determines validity, algorithm choice does not

E. 180-Day Advance Notice Protocol

**Requirement**: Any cryptographic algorithm change MUST be announced 180 days in advance.

**Notification channels**:
- Public announcement on MW canonical registry
- Email notification to all licensed institutions
- Blockchain attestation (immutable timestamp)

**Notice content**:
- Current algorithm being deprecated
- New algorithm being adopted
- Effective date (180 days from announcement)
- Migration guide (how institutions update verification infrastructure)
- Technical specifications (hash length, signature format, validation procedure)

**Example notice** (hypothetical 2029 announcement):
```
CRYPTOGRAPHIC MIGRATION NOTICE
Date: 2029-06-01
Effective Date: 2029-12-01 (180 days)

Current algorithm: SHA-256 (512-bit hash output)
Deprecated effective: 2029-12-01

New algorithm: CRYSTALS-Dilithium (NIST FIPS 204)
Primary algorithm effective: 2029-12-01

Action required:
Institutions must upgrade verification infrastructure to support Dilithium by 2029-12-01.
Dual-signed artifacts will be accepted until 2035-01-01 (backward compatibility).

Migration guide: https://mw-canonical-registry.org/crypto-migration-2029
Technical specifications: NIST FIPS 204
```

F. Grandfather Clause for Historical Artifacts

**Principle**: Artifacts signed with deprecated algorithm BEFORE deprecation date remain valid indefinitely.

**Example**:
- Artifact signed with SHA-256 on 2028-05-15 (before 2029-12-01 deprecation)
- SHA-256 deprecated on 2029-12-01
- Artifact remains valid in 2075 even though SHA-256 no longer accepted for NEW signatures
- Institutions verifying in 2075 must maintain SHA-256 verification capability for historical artifacts (legacy verification infrastructure)

**Rationale**: Retroactive invalidation would void institutional reliance on historical determinations. Temporal permanence requires backward compatibility forever.

________________


XIV. ENFORCEMENT ENTITY & AUDIT TRAIL INFRASTRUCTURE

A. Determinism Verification Consortium (DVC)

**Primary enforcement entity**: Determinism Verification Consortium (DVC)

**Composition**: 
- 5 independent organizations (rotated biennially, not annually like IVC)
- Technical expertise: Computer science, cryptography, formal verification
- No financial interest in MW adoption
- Geographically distributed (US, EU, APAC minimum)

**DVC vs. IVC distinction**:
- IVC (Document 2): Verifies layer compliance (governance structure)
- DVC (this document): Verifies determinism (execution behavior)
- Independent organizations (DVC cannot be IVC member, avoids conflict of interest)

**DVC Responsibilities**:
1. Conduct quarterly determinism verification (1,000+ trial minimum)
2. Operate public verification results registry
3. Log non-determinism incidents with timestamp
4. Publish annual determinism compliance report
5. Maintain determinism testing infrastructure (test harness, automated trial execution)

**DVC Funding**: 3% of annual MW revenue (separate from IVC's 5%)

**Rationale for separate funding**: Determinism verification is technically distinct from layer compliance verification. Requires different expertise (computer scientists vs. lawyers/auditors). Separate funding ensures adequate resources for both.

B. Public Determinism Audit Trail

**Technology**: Same blockchain infrastructure as IVC (Document 2, Section IV-G)
- Primary: Ethereum Mainnet
- Backup 1: Polygon PoS
- Backup 2: Arbitrum One
- Failover protocol: 24-hour unavailability trigger

**Audit trail record schema**:
```json
{
  "verification_id": "UUID",
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 datetime",
  "authority": "Authority name + layer",
  "trial_count": "Integer, minimum 1000",
  "pass_count": "Integer",
  "fail_count": "Integer",
  "pass_rate": "Percentage, 100.00% required for PASS",
  "overall_result": "PASS | FAIL",
  "verifier": "DVC member organization name",
  "failed_trials": "Array of trial IDs where non-determinism detected (if any)",
  "hash": "SHA-256 of verification report"
}
```

**Query capability**: Any institution can query:
- Has specific authority passed recent determinism verification? (Yes/No)
- When was authority last verified? (Timestamp)
- What is authority's historical pass rate? (Percentage over time)
- Have any non-determinism incidents been logged? (Count)

C. Non-Determinism Incident Logging

**Trigger**: Any failed determinism trial logged immediately.

**Incident report format**:
```json
{
  "incident_id": "UUID",
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 datetime",
  "authority": "Authority name",
  "input": "Exact input that triggered non-determinism",
  "output_1": "First execution output",
  "output_2": "Second execution output (different from output_1)",
  "execution_context_1": "Time, jurisdiction, operator for first execution",
  "execution_context_2": "Time, jurisdiction, operator for second execution",
  "determinism_violation_type": "Temporal | Geographic | Operator | External-condition",
  "consequence": "Authority canonical status terminated",
  "hash": "SHA-256 of incident report"
}
```

**Public accessibility**: All incident reports public (except confidential institution identifiers redacted).

**Institutional notification**: All licensed institutions automatically notified within 1 hour of non-determinism incident via email + push notification.

________________


XV. CHOICE OF LAW & DISPUTE RESOLUTION

A. Governing Law

**This Charter governed by Delaware General Corporation Law** (primary).

**Exception**: Technical determinism standards governed by international computer science consensus (IEEE, NIST, ISO/IEC standards where applicable).

**Rationale**: Determinism is mathematical/technical concept, not purely legal. Courts defer to technical standards for determinism definition.

B. Dispute Resolution for Non-Determinism Challenges

**Scope**: This section governs disputes about whether authority exhibits determinism (not service disputes).

**Hierarchy**:

**First**: Technical reproducibility test (30 days)
* Institution submits alleged non-deterministic query to DVC
* DVC executes 100-trial reproducibility test
* If 100/100 trials produce identical output â†’ institution's challenge rejected
* If any trial produces different output â†’ non-determinism confirmed

**Second**: Expert technical review (if reproducibility test inconclusive)
* Panel of 3 computer scientists (appointed by IEEE or ACM)
* Review authority's source code, execution logs, infrastructure
* Issue determination: DETERMINISTIC or NON-DETERMINISTIC
* Determination binding and final

**Third**: Binding arbitration (if expert review unavailable)
* JAMS (Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services) - Technology Disputes Panel
* Single arbitrator with computer science Ph.D. + 10+ years software engineering experience
* Seat: San Francisco, California (technology hub)
* Governing rules: JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules
* Language: English

**No judicial appeals**: Technical determinism determinations are final. Courts cannot second-guess computer science expert panels or arbitrators on factual question "is algorithm deterministic?"

Courts retain jurisdiction over procedural fairness (expert conflict of interest, arbitrator bias) but not technical determinations.

C. Institutional Standing

**Who can challenge determinism**:
* Any institution with active MW license
* Any institution that relied on allegedly non-deterministic authority
* DVC members (can initiate sua sponte review)
* Peer authorities (can challenge if non-determinism affects interoperability)

**Who CANNOT challenge**:
* General public (no MW relationship)
* Terminated authorities (no standing post-termination)
* Founder (post-deployment, no special standing)

D. Remedy Limitations

**Available remedies**:
* Authority termination (if non-determinism confirmed)
* Public incident logging (transparency)
* Institution notification (warning)

**Unavailable remedies**:
* Monetary damages against MW entities (institutions bear reliance risk)
* Injunctions preventing termination (termination is automatic)
* Restoration of terminated authority (no resurrection)
* Refunds for fees paid to non-deterministic authority

**Rationale**: Determinism enforcement is mechanical. Discretionary remedies (damages, injunctions) introduce judgment calls, undermining determinism itself.

E. Severability & Survival

**Severability**:
- If any provision held invalid, remainder remains valid
- Severability applies to sections, subsections independently

**Non-Severable Provisions** (invalidation voids entire Section XV):
1. Choice of Law (Delaware + IEEE/NIST technical standards)
2. Dispute Resolution Hierarchy (Technical test â†’ Expert review â†’ Arbitration)
3. No Judicial Review of technical determinations

**Survival Provisions** (persist after Charter termination):
- Dispute resolution procedures: Until all pending challenges resolved
- Non-determinism incident logs: Permanent retention
- DVC funding obligations: Until all quarterly verifications complete

XVI. MULTI-JURISDICTION DETERMINISM COMPLIANCE

A. Determinism as Universal Mathematical Standard

**Principle**: Determinism is mathematical property, not legal construct. Same algorithm produces same output regardless of jurisdiction.

**Implication**: MW authorities operate identically in all jurisdictions OR do not operate at all.

**No jurisdiction-specific customization permitted**: Even if local law requires it.

B. Jurisdiction Prohibition Protocol

**Scenario**: Jurisdiction X law requires MW authority to modify outputs for local compliance.

**Example**: EU regulation requires additional data fields in outputs. Singapore MAS requires different timestamp precision. China requires state access to cryptographic keys.

**MW response**: Authority does NOT modify outputs. Instead:

**Option A**: Authority declines to operate in Jurisdiction X (dormancy in that jurisdiction only)
**Option B**: Jurisdiction X institutions access authority from different jurisdiction (extraterritorial access)
**Option C**: Authority terminates entirely if global operation impossible

**No Option D**: Customize outputs for Jurisdiction X (violates determinism)

C. Extraterritorial Access Rights

**Principle**: If authority cannot operate in Jurisdiction X due to local law conflict, institutions in Jurisdiction X may access authority hosted in Jurisdiction Y.

**Mechanism**:
- Singapore institution accesses Delaware-hosted authority
- Output identical to what Singapore-hosted instance would produce (if it could operate)
- Singapore law may prohibit reliance on Delaware output, but MW determinism preserved

**Institution risk**: Jurisdiction X may not recognize extraterritorial determinations. Institution bears legal risk of relying on foreign-hosted authority.

**MW neutrality**: MW ensures determinism (technical property). Whether jurisdiction recognizes foreign outputs is legal question beyond MW scope.

D. Cryptographic Export Control Compliance

**Challenge**: Some jurisdictions restrict cryptographic algorithm export (e.g., US historical restrictions, China current restrictions).

**MW approach**: Use only publicly published, export-unrestricted algorithms.

**Approved algorithms**:
- SHA-256: No export restrictions (public standard)
- CRYSTALS-Dilithium: NIST PQC standard, publicly published, no restrictions
- AES-256: Approved for export under U.S. regulations

**Prohibited algorithms**: Any algorithm subject to export control or government key escrow requirements.

**Rationale**: Export-restricted algorithms prevent global deterministic operation (same algorithm cannot be deployed in all jurisdictions).

XVII. VERIFICATION COST MODEL & DVC FUNDING

A. DVC Funding Allocation

**Revenue source**: 3% of annual MW revenue (distinct from IVC's 5%)

**Calculation example** (Year 5, $10M revenue scenario):
- Total MW Revenue: $10M
- DVC Allocation: $300K (3%)
- Operating budget breakdown:
  * Quarterly determinism verification: $120K (4 verifications Ã— $30K each)
  * Automated testing infrastructure: $80K (AWS, test harness, CI/CD)
  * DVC staff compensation: $60K (5 part-time technical experts @ $12K each)
  * Incident investigation: $20K (deep-dive analysis of non-determinism reports)
  * Annual compliance reporting: $20K (publication, distribution, blockchain logging)

**Remaining MW revenue after DVC+IVC**: $9.2M (10M - 5% IVC - 3% DVC)

B. Challenge Cost Allocation

**Institution filing non-determinism challenge**: $2,500 filing fee (lower than IVC's $5,000 because technical verification cheaper than legal investigation)

**Fee refund conditions**:
- If non-determinism confirmed â†’ Full refund + authority pays investigation costs
- If challenge rejected (100/100 reproducibility trials pass) â†’ Fee forfeited, funds DVC operations

**Authority cost recovery** (if non-determinism confirmed):
- Authority terminated immediately (cannot recover costs, authority is dead)
- Authority's final revenue distribution includes penalty: reimburse all filing fees from successful challenges in last 12 months

C. DVC Funding Sustainability Stress Test

**Scenario**: What if DVC costs exceed 3% allocation?

**Example** (Year 3, pessimistic):
- MW Revenue: $800K (low adoption)
- DVC Allocation: $24K (3%)
- Actual DVC costs: $140K (multiple non-determinism incidents requiring deep investigation)
- Deficit: -$116K

**Contingency Protocol**:

**Phase 1**: Emergency DVC budget reduction
- Reduce verification frequency: Quarterly â†’ Biannual (4/year â†’ 2/year)
- Limit trial count: 1,000 trials â†’ 500 trials (still statistically significant)
- Defer infrastructure upgrades, minimize AWS costs

**Phase 2**: Increase DVC allocation percentage (requires unanimous 17/17 Layer-3 authority vote)
- Propose increase: 3% â†’ 5% (narrows gap with IVC funding)
- Vote required: 17/17 (constitutional change)
- If approved: DVC allocation increases, reduced revenue flows to authorities

**Phase 3**: If funding still insufficient, enter verification dormancy
- DVC operations suspended temporarily
- Non-determinism incidents logged but not actively verified
- Institutions bear 100% verification responsibility (self-test determinism)
- MW continues operating but without active DVC enforcement
- Reactivate DVC when revenue increases above threshold

**Reactivation threshold**: $2M annual revenue minimum (ensures $60K DVC allocation, covers basic operations)

D. Cost-Benefit Analysis: DVC vs. Institutional Self-Verification

**Question**: Why fund centralized DVC? Why not let institutions verify determinism themselves?

**Answer**:

**Centralized DVC advantages**:
1. **Expertise concentration**: DVC employs full-time computer scientists with formal verification expertise. Individual institutions lack this specialized knowledge.
2. **Economies of scale**: DVC verifies once, all institutions benefit. Institutional self-verification = wasteful duplication (1,000 institutions each running 1,000 trials = 1M total trials vs. DVC running 1,000 trials once).
3. **Public goods problem**: Determinism verification benefits all institutions, but individual institution has weak incentive to fund (free-rider problem). Centralized funding via revenue allocation solves public goods problem.
4. **Trust**: Independent DVC creates institutional confidence. Institution self-verification subject to conflicts of interest.

**Institutional self-verification role**: Institutions may ADDITIONALLY verify determinism (defense-in-depth). DVC provides baseline, institutions can exceed if desired.

XVIII. EXAMPLES & CASE STUDIES

A. Non-Determinism Case Study #1: Timestamp Timezone Violation

**Scenario** (Year 2027):

GEAA (Global Evidence Admissibility Authority) processes query from New York institution at 10:00 AM EST.

Output: {"timestamp": "2027-03-15T10:00:00-05:00", ...}

Identical query from London institution at 3:00 PM GMT (same absolute moment):

Output: {"timestamp": "2027-03-15T15:00:00+00:00", ...}

**Analysis**:

**Requirement**: ISO 8601 with UTC mandatory (Section II-B-4)

**First output**: Timestamp in EST (-05:00 offset) = NON-COMPLIANT
**Second output**: Timestamp in GMT/UTC (+00:00 offset) = COMPLIANT

**Violation**: Output depends on query origin jurisdiction â†’ NON-DETERMINISTIC

**Determinism test**:
- Same absolute moment (10 AM EST = 3 PM GMT)
- Different timestamp representations
- Bit-for-bit comparison: FAIL

**Consequence**:
- GEAA loses canonical status immediately
- All GEAA determinations void retroactively
- Institutions that relied on GEAA certifications before detection: good-faith reliance protection applies (Document 2, Section IV-D)

**Lesson**: Even "minor" output format differences (timezone) violate determinism. Absolute consistency required.

---

B. Non-Determinism Case Study #2: "Smart" Optimization

**Scenario** (Year 2029):

IRUA implements "performance optimization":

"If query from repeat customer (>100 previous queries), cache result and return instantly without recomputing."

**First query** from Goldman Sachs for Transaction TX123456:
- Full computation executed
- Output: {"status": "IRREVERSIBLE", "computation_time_ms": 450, ...}

**Second query** (1 hour later, identical transaction):
- Cache hit
- Output: {"status": "IRREVERSIBLE", "computation_time_ms": 12, ...}

**Analysis**:

**Requirement**: Identical inputs â†’ identical outputs (Section II-A)

**Problem**: Outputs differ in computation_time_ms field

**Defense**: "Computation time is metadata, not substantive determination."

**Rebuttal**: Output specification (Section VII-B) requires ALL fields deterministic. No "metadata exception."

**Determinism test**:
- Input: TX123456 (identical)
- Output 1: computation_time_ms=450
- Output 2: computation_time_ms=12
- Bit-for-bit comparison: FAIL

**Consequence**: IRUA terminated for non-determinism

**Correct implementation**: Remove computation_time_ms from output entirely, OR always report 0 (deterministic constant), OR report actual computation time but exclude from determinism verification (separate logging channel, not part of canonical output).

**Lesson**: "Optimizations" that change outputs = non-determinism violations. Performance is operational concern, not output concern.

---

C. Non-Determinism Case Study #3: Market-Dependent Processing

**Scenario** (Year 2032):

GCPA (Global Capital & Portfolio Authority) implements "market-aware risk assessment":

"During high volatility (VIX >30), apply enhanced scrutiny to portfolio allocations."

**Query during calm market** (VIX=15):
- Portfolio allocation request: 60% equities, 40% bonds
- Output: {"approval_status": "APPROVED", ...}

**Identical query during volatile market** (VIX=45):
- Portfolio allocation request: 60% equities, 40% bonds (SAME allocation)
- Output: {"approval_status": "REQUIRES_ADDITIONAL_REVIEW", ...}

**Analysis**:

**Requirement**: Output independent of external market conditions (Section XII-A)

**Violation**: Same portfolio allocation â†’ different approval status based on VIX

**Determinism test**:
- Input: 60/40 portfolio (identical)
- Market context: VIX=15 vs. VIX=45 (external condition)
- Output: APPROVED vs. REQUIRES_ADDITIONAL_REVIEW (different)
- Bit-for-bit comparison: FAIL

**Consequence**: GCPA terminated for non-determinism

**Correct implementation**: If portfolio risk assessment requires volatility context, volatility MUST BE EXPLICIT INPUT (not external condition).

Deterministic query: {"portfolio": "60/40", "market_vix": 45} â†’ Output deterministic based on inputs

Non-deterministic query: {"portfolio": "60/40"} â†’ Output varies based on external VIX reading

**Lesson**: External conditions cannot influence outputs. All decision factors must be explicit inputs.

---

D. Non-Determinism Case Study #4: Operator-Dependent "Enhancement"

**Scenario** (Year 2035):

CivicHabâ„¢ implements "VIP service":

"For major institutional clients (assets >$10B), provide enhanced spatial certification with additional analysis."

**Query from small credit union** (assets=$500M):
- Building certification request: Building X
- Output: {"certification": "COMPLIANT", "analysis_depth": "STANDARD"}

**Identical query from Goldman Sachs** (assets=$2T):
- Building certification request: Building X (SAME building)
- Output: {"certification": "COMPLIANT", "analysis_depth": "ENHANCED", "additional_notes": "..."}

**Analysis**:

**Requirement**: Output independent of operator identity (Section X-A)

**Violation**: Same building â†’ different output based on querying institution

**Determinism test**:
- Input: Building X (identical)
- Operator: Credit union vs. Goldman Sachs
- Output: analysis_depth=STANDARD vs. ENHANCED (different)
- Bit-for-bit comparison: FAIL

**Consequence**: CivicHabâ„¢ terminated for non-determinism

**Correct implementation**: If enhanced analysis available, make it UNIVERSAL (all queries receive enhanced analysis) OR create separate authority tiers with different scopes (but same tier produces identical outputs for all operators).

**Lesson**: "VIP treatment" = non-determinism. Operator identity cannot affect outputs.

---

E. Permitted Variation Case Study #1: Cryptographic Nonce (COMPLIANT)

**Scenario** (Year 2026):

SICA (Standards Issuance & Custody Authority) issues artifact with cryptographic signature.

**First issuance**:
- Artifact content: {...}
- Cryptographic nonce: 0x7A3F2B...
- Signature: 0x9D4E1C...

**Second issuance** (identical content):
- Artifact content: {...} (IDENTICAL)
- Cryptographic nonce: 0x2C8D5A... (DIFFERENT)
- Signature: 0x4F7B2E... (DIFFERENT, because nonce different)

**Analysis**:

**Question**: Do different signatures violate determinism?

**Answer**: NO, permitted exception (Section VI-A)

**Rationale**: Cryptographic security REQUIRES random nonces. Reusing nonces compromises security.

**Determinism preservation**: Artifact CONTENT identical. Signatures differ only due to security-required randomness, not decision-making randomness.

**Verification**: Institution verifies signature matches content (cryptographic validation). Nonce variation acceptable for security.

**Lesson**: Security-required randomness permitted. Decision-making randomness prohibited.

---

F. Temporal Permanence Case Study: 50-Year Determinism Verification

**Scenario** (Year 2075):

Institution submits verification test: "Does IRUA still operate deterministically 50 years after deployment?"

**Test procedure**:
1. Retrieve historical IRUA query from 2025 archives
2. Query: Transaction TX999888 irreversibility status
3. Original 2025 output: {"status": "IRREVERSIBLE", "timestamp": "2025-06-15T10:30:00.000Z", ...}
4. Resubmit identical query in 2075
5. 2075 output: {"status": "IRREVERSIBLE", "timestamp": "2075-06-15T14:22:00.000Z", ...}

**Comparison**:
- Status field: IDENTICAL (IRREVERSIBLE)
- Timestamp field: DIFFERENT (2025 vs. 2075) â€” PERMITTED (timestamp reflects execution time per Section IX-A)
- All other fields: IDENTICAL

**Determinism verdict**: PASS

**Conclusion**: IRUA maintained determinism for 50 years. Historical consistency requirement (Section IX-B) satisfied.

**Lesson**: Temporal permanence is measurable. 50-year determinism is achievement worth celebratingâ€”proves institutional infrastructure resilience.

XIX. VERIFICATION QUALITY CONTROL & INTER-VERIFIER RELIABILITY

A. DVC Verifier Calibration Protocol

**Challenge**: 5 different DVC member organizations may apply determinism tests differently, introducing verification inconsistency.

**Solution**: Annual verifier calibration workshops.

**Calibration Process**:

**Step 1**: DVC prepares 20 reference test cases
- 10 clearly deterministic authorities
- 10 clearly non-deterministic authorities (known violations planted)

**Step 2**: All 5 DVC members independently verify all 20 test cases

**Step 3**: Compare results
- Calculate inter-verifier agreement (IVA)
- IVA = (number of cases where all 5 verifiers agree) / (total cases)
- Minimum IVA: 95% (19/20 cases agreement required)

**Step 4**: Resolve disagreements
- Convene calibration workshop
- Discuss cases where verifiers disagreed
- Establish consensus interpretation of determinism requirements
- Update verification methodology documentation

**Step 5**: Retest
- Verifiers re-verify disagreement cases
- Confirm 100% agreement achieved post-calibration

**Frequency**: Annually (every February)

**Consequence of low IVA** (<95%):
- If IVA <95% for 2 consecutive years â†’ DVC restructuring required
- Replace underperforming verifier organization
- Increase calibration frequency to quarterly until IVA >95% achieved

B. Automated Determinism Testing Infrastructure

**Challenge**: Manual verification (humans running 1,000 trials) is slow, expensive, error-prone.

**Solution**: Automated test harness.

**Test Harness Architecture**:

**Component 1**: Test Case Generator
- Automatically generates 1,000 diverse input queries
- Covers edge cases, boundary values, typical cases
- Ensures comprehensive coverage of authority's input domain

**Component 2**: Parallel Execution Engine
- Submits identical queries to authority from different:
  * Geographic locations (US, EU, APAC)
  * Timestamps (spread over 24-hour period)
  * Operator accounts (simulated institutional identities)

**Component 3**: Bit-for-Bit Comparator
- Compares all outputs byte-by-byte
- Flags any differences (even single-bit deviation)
- Generates pass/fail verdict for each trial

**Component 4**: Report Generator
- Aggregates trial results
- Calculates pass rate
- Produces standardized verification report (Section IV-D format)

**Cost savings**: Automated harness reduces verification cost from $30K/quarter to $5K/quarter (83% reduction). Frees up DVC budget for deeper incident investigations.

**Open source**: Test harness code published open-source (MIT license). Institutions may run their own determinism tests using same infrastructure.

C. Measurement Precision & Statistical Confidence

**Question**: How many trials required for 99.9% confidence that authority is deterministic?

**Statistical analysis**:

**Assumptions**:
- Null hypothesis: Authority is non-deterministic with 0.1% failure rate (1 in 1,000 queries non-deterministic)
- Alternative hypothesis: Authority is perfectly deterministic (0% failure rate)

**Trial count calculation**:
- To detect 0.1% failure rate with 99.9% confidence: ~4,600 trials required
- MW standard (1,000 trials): Detects 0.46% failure rate with 99.9% confidence
- Trade-off: Higher trial count = higher cost but greater precision

**MW decision**: 1,000 trials sufficient for baseline verification. If suspicion of non-determinism, escalate to 10,000-trial deep verification.

**False positive rate**: <0.01% (1 in 10,000 perfectly deterministic authorities incorrectly flagged as non-deterministic)

**False negative rate**: <0.1% (1 in 1,000 non-deterministic authorities incorrectly certified as deterministic)

**Risk tolerance**: Institutions may demand higher precision. DVC accommodates custom verification requests (10,000+ trials) for fee.

________________


XX. HISTORICAL DESIGN EVOLUTION & LESSONS LEARNED

A. Original Determinism Specification (2023, Pre-Canonical)

**Original approach**: "Authorities should strive for determinism where practical."

**Problems with "strive for" language**:
1. "Should" = recommendation, not requirement â†’ Authorities ignored determinism
2. "Where practical" = loophole â†’ Authorities claimed non-determinism "impractical" for their domain
3. No enforcement mechanism â†’ Non-deterministic authorities deployed, institutions relied, chaos ensued

**Failure mode** (2024 prototype):
- IRUA claimed "irreversibility is subjective concept, cannot be deterministic"
- GEAA claimed "evidence admissibility requires judicial discretion, determinism impossible"
- Result: Institutional confusion (same query â†’ different answers), MW adoption failed

B. Determinism Absolutism (2024 Revision)

**Revised approach**: "Determinism is ABSOLUTE. 100% required. No exceptions."

**Overcorrection problem**:
- Cryptographic nonces flagged as non-deterministic violations
- Human query variations (typos, synonym usage) caused verification failures
- Geographic distribution (different data center locations) considered non-deterministic

**Result**: Technically correct but operationally unworkable. Authorities could not achieve 100% determinism due to unavoidable technical realities.

C. Narrow Exceptions Framework (2025, Final)

**Balanced approach**: Determinism is default absolute, with 3 EXPLICITLY ENUMERATED narrow exceptions (Section VI).

**Why this works**:
1. Default to absolute (preserves institutional reliance)
2. Exceptions exhaustively specified (no "and other practical considerations" loophole)
3. Exceptions limited to unavoidable technical realities (cryptography, human input, infrastructure distribution)

**Design lesson for MW-2**: Absolutism works IF exceptions are precisely defined upfront. "Flexible" standards collapse into non-standards.

D. Verification Methodology Evolution

**Original method** (2023): "Run query twice, compare outputs"

**Problem**: 2 trials insufficient. Non-determinism with 50% occurrence rate detectable, but subtle non-determinism (0.1% rate) undetectable.

**Revision 1** (2024): "Run query 10 times"

**Problem**: 10 trials still insufficient for statistical confidence. 10 trials detects 9.5% failure rate (too coarse).

**Final method** (2025): "Run query 1,000 times across temporal/geographic/operator variation"

**Why 1,000**:
- Detects 0.46% failure rate with 99.9% confidence (Section XIX-C)
- Covers sufficient variation dimensions (time Ã— geography Ã— operator Ã— external conditions)
- Computationally feasible (automated harness executes 1,000 trials in ~2 hours)

**Design lesson for MW-2**: Statistical rigor matters. "Eyeball testing" insufficient for institutional-grade determinism verification.

E. Cost-Benefit Trade-offs

**Question debated** (2024): Should determinism verification be free (funded entirely by authorities) or paid (institutions pay per verification)?

**Free verification**:
- Advantage: Removes cost barrier to institutional adoption
- Disadvantage: Creates funding gap (who pays for DVC operations?)

**Paid verification**:
- Advantage: Self-funding (institutions pay, DVC costs covered)
- Disadvantage: Institutions skip verification to save money â†’ defeats purpose

**Chosen model** (2025): Hybrid
- Baseline verification free (funded by 3% MW revenue allocation)
- Custom/enhanced verification paid (institutions wanting 10,000+ trial deep verification pay marginal cost)

**Design lesson for MW-2**: Public goods (determinism verification benefits all institutions) require collective funding. User-pays model fails for public goods.

XXI. INTERFACE WITH OTHER SYSTEM CHARTERS

A. Related Charters

This law interfaces with:

**MW Canon (Document 1)**: Establishes Run-Only Law (Law 1) and No-Feedback Law (Law 3) that this document enforces in detail.

**Layer Architecture & Non-Escalation Charter (Document 2)**: Determinism applies to all layers. Layer hierarchy must be enforced deterministically.

**Issuance & Decision Admissibility Charter (Document 4)**: Artifacts issued must be deterministic. Institutions rely on determinism for admissibility.

**Pricing/Fee Primitives Charter (Document 5)**: Pricing must be deterministic. Same usage = same fee, always.

B. Determinism as Foundation

Determinism is prerequisite for:
* Institutional reliance (institutions cannot rely on non-deterministic outputs)
* Legal admissibility (courts require predictable evidence standards)
* Financial pricing (GCRAâ„¢ requires deterministic inputs for pricing)
* Temporal permanence (100+ year validity requires unchanging behavior)
* Founder irrelevance (if behavior changes, founder interpretation becomes necessary)

All other MW principles collapse without determinism.

C. Cross-Document Consistency Protocol

**Problem**: If this Charter contradicts MW Canon on determinism requirements, which governs?

**Solution**: MW Canon always governs (Document 2, Section XIV-B).

**Consistency verification**:
1. Compare this Charter's provisions to MW Canon Laws 1-3
2. Identify any contradictions
3. MW Canon provision prevails
4. This Charter's contradicting provision is void
5. Remainder of Charter remains valid (severability)

**Current consistency status**: All provisions reviewed. Zero contradictions detected.

**Ongoing monitoring**: DVC quarterly verification includes cross-document consistency check.
