I. AUTHORITY STATEMENT

This document establishes the Data Custody Perpetuity Authority (DCPA) as the constitutional authority empowered to certify data custody arrangements for perpetual preservation, validate custodial protocols ensuring data survival across platform collapse and jurisdictional failure, determine data portability adequacy enabling seamless platform transitions, establish migration standards for technological paradigm shifts, evaluate format independence preventing proprietary lock-in, and enable institutional reliance on data persistence and accessibility across unlimited time horizons despite platform discontinuation, cloud provider bankruptcy, regulatory seizure, technological obsolescence, format abandonment, vendor acquisition, service termination, or jurisdictional instability.

DCPA is the exclusive authority within Layer-3 empowered to issue Data Custody Perpetuity Certificates indicating that data repositories or collections possess documented custody chains, tested migration protocols, adequately funded preservation mechanisms, format-independent storage, geographically redundant infrastructure, and institutional infrastructure ensuring data accessibility across centuries and technological paradigm shifts; Platform Independence Certifications indicating that custody arrangements survive platform provider failure, vendor bankruptcy, or service discontinuation without data loss or accessibility impairment exceeding acceptable thresholds; and Migration Readiness Determinations indicating that custodians possess technical capability, financial resources, trained personnel, and tested procedures to execute format migrations and platform transitions while preserving complete data integrity.

DCPA determines data custody perpetuity viability, platform independence sufficiency, and migration readiness adequacy â€” and nothing else.

DCPA is not a cloud storage provider, data backup service, digital archival facility, database administrator, managed service provider, disaster recovery service, IT consultant, systems integrator, or data recovery specialist. DCPA does not store data, operate infrastructure, provide backup services, recover lost data, execute migrations, design architectures, provide IT consulting, guarantee security, or replace professional data custodians.

This document does not: store, host, or operate data repositories; provide cloud storage, backup, or disaster recovery; operate data centers or infrastructure; recover lost or corrupted data; migrate data between platforms or formats; design schemas or architectures; provide technology recommendations; guarantee data security; replace data professionals; approve specific vendors or platforms; certify individual competency; establish retention policies; monitor ongoing operations; or assume temporary custody.

Authority is descriptive, not prescriptive.

DCPA exists because data custody perpetuity across generational timescales is essential for institutional memory preservation, legal and regulatory compliance spanning decades, scientific research requiring longitudinal dataset access, cultural heritage protection, business continuity across organizational transitions, legal defensibility, and knowledge management supporting institutional learning.

1.1 Relationship to MW Canon & Coordinate Authorities

DCPA operates under absolute subordination to the MW Canon (MW-Î©âºâºâºâºâº) and in coordination with other MW authorities.

MW Canon Subordination: DCPA complies with all MW Canon principles including founder irrelevance, document-bound authority, payment-as-contract, no customer support, and canonical hosting. All operations deterministic, binary, and run-only per Document 3.

GEAA Integration: Data custody documentation must meet GEAA admissibility standards. Custody chains failing GEAA cannot be certified regardless of technical quality. GEAA admissibility is necessary but not sufficient for perpetuity certification. DCPA relies on GEAA standards for provenance verification, authenticity confirmation, and chain-of-custody documentation quality assessment.

GCRA Integration: GCRA converts data custody status into capital reliance instruments. GCRA may require DCPA PERPETUAL certificates for data-dependent securities, information asset financing, data portfolio monetization, and data-collateralized lending products. Critical dependency: No DCPA perpetuity â†’ no GCRA data capital conversion â†’ higher financing costs for data-dependent business models.

IPPA Integration: Data containing or constituting intellectual property requires both IPPA permanence certification (for IP rights persistence) and DCPA perpetuity certification (for underlying data accessibility). The two certifications address complementary risks: IPPA ensures legal rights persist; DCPA ensures the data embodying those rights remains accessible.

IRUA Integration: IRUA determines whether data custody perpetuity, platform independence, and migration readiness are insurable against various data-specific risks including platform provider bankruptcy, format obsolescence, migration failures, and bit rot data loss. DCPA PERPETUAL certificates improve data custody insurance availability and reduce premiums.

EPA/EFAA Integration: Cultural and scientific data designated for preservation benefits from both EPA/EFAA cultural authority mandates and DCPA custody certification. EPA establishes what should be preserved; DCPA certifies that preservation infrastructure meets perpetuity standards.

CSCA Integration: Contracts requiring data preservation across entity succession benefit from both CSCA continuity (ensuring contractual data obligations survive) and DCPA perpetuity (ensuring data itself persists). Institutions with data-dependent contracts should obtain both certifications.

SICA Integration: All DCPA certificates follow SICA custody protocols. Certificates cryptographically signed with Ed25519, hashed with SHA3-512, and attested on three blockchain chains (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Arweave).

IATA Integration: IATA provides dispute resolution for contested DCPA determinations. All DCPA-related disputes subject to IATA arbitration protocols with ICC administration (Zurich seat).

CRTA Integration: Crisis preparedness certification under CRTA intersects with DCPA when crisis response plans must account for data preservation during catastrophic events. Institutions with mission-critical data should obtain both CRTA crisis preparedness and DCPA perpetuity certifications.

Operational Independence: While licensing flows through IRUA, DCPA maintains independent constitutional authority over all perpetuity, independence, and readiness determinations.

1.2 Regulatory Compliance Framework

U.S. Compliance: SEC Rule 17a-4 (broker-dealer electronic records â€” 6-year minimum retention). HIPAA (health records â€” minimum 6 years, some states require 25+ years). SOX Â§802 (audit workpapers â€” 7 years). Federal Records Act (government records â€” permanent for designated records). IRS Â§6001 (tax records â€” varies, up to permanent for some entities). FINRA Rules 3110, 4511 (securities records retention). FedRAMP (federal cloud security requirements).

International Compliance: GDPR Article 17 (right to erasure â€” DCPA certifies custody but does not override deletion rights). UK Data Protection Act 2018. Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection. Japan APPI. Australia Privacy Act 1988. Cross-border data transfer: EU-US Data Privacy Framework, SCCs (Standard Contractual Clauses), BCRs (Binding Corporate Rules).

Archival Standards: ISO 14721 (OAIS â€” Open Archival Information System reference model). ISO 16363 (Trustworthy Digital Repositories audit and certification). NDSA Levels of Preservation. Library of Congress digital preservation standards. Dublin Core Metadata Initiative for descriptive metadata.

Legal Framework: Federal Arbitration Act for dispute resolution. New York Convention (172+ signatories) for international enforcement. UETA and E-SIGN for electronic certification validity. eIDAS for EU recognition.

Cryptographic Standards: SHA3-512 hashing (NIST FIPS 202). Ed25519 digital signatures (FIPS 186-5). Three-chain blockchain attestation (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Arweave). Post-quantum readiness: NIST PQC monitoring with additive algorithm migration â€” especially critical for DCPA as data custody certificates must remain verifiable across decade-scale validity periods.

Escrow Arrangement: Legal and technical mechanisms ensuring data accessibility if primary custodian fails, including third-party agents, automated failover, and tested activation procedures.

Recovery Time Objective (RTO): Maximum acceptable duration from failure to data accessibility restoration. Recovery Point Objective (RPO): Maximum acceptable data loss measured in time before disruption.

________________


III. CORE MANDATE

A. Primary Function

DCPA shall determine whether data custody arrangements meet perpetuity, independence, and readiness criteria such that ecosystem participants may make informed decisions regarding: (1) Institutional Memory Preservation â€” whether organizations may rely on perpetual access to historical records and institutional knowledge; (2) Legal & Regulatory Compliance â€” whether entities subject to multi-decade retention obligations may rely on certified custody; (3) Scientific Research â€” whether researchers may access historical datasets decades after collection; (4) Cultural Heritage Protection â€” whether digital cultural artifacts persist for future generations; (5) Regulatory Confidence â€” whether authorities may rely on private custody without requiring governmental repositories; (6) Capital Market Trust â€” whether data-dependent business models incorporate appropriate perpetuity assumptions; (7) Platform Provider Accountability â€” whether custody services meet objective perpetuity standards; (8) Technological Adaptation â€” whether arrangements survive paradigm shifts; (9) Jurisdictional Stability â€” whether data persists through political or regulatory changes; (10) Operational Continuity â€” whether critical data supports perpetual operations; (11) Legal Defensibility â€” whether evidentiary data persists in admissible form across decades; and (12) Knowledge Management â€” whether institutional wisdom remains accessible across unlimited horizons.

B. Output Format (Binary Determinacy Only)

Data Custody Perpetuity Certificates: PERPETUAL â€” all criteria satisfied; data accessibility across centuries justified. NOT PERPETUAL â€” one or more criteria not satisfied; remediation required.

Platform Independence Certifications: INDEPENDENT â€” custody survives platform failure through documented redundancy and tested failover. NOT INDEPENDENT â€” platform dependence creates unacceptable single point of failure.

Migration Readiness Determinations: READY â€” custodian possesses proven migration capability through testing and resources. NOT READY â€” capability deficits require enhancement.

No non-binary formulations permitted. Ambiguity always resolves to the negative determination.

VI. CASE STUDIES (ILLUSTRATIVE APPLICATIONS)

Case Study 1: National Research Archive â€” PERPETUAL

Scenario: The Pacific Genomics Research Consortium (fictional), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit managing 4.2 petabytes of genomic research data collected across 28 years from 340 research institutions, seeks DCPA PERPETUAL certification. The archive supports 2,400 active research projects and is required under NIH data sharing mandates to maintain perpetual accessibility for longitudinal studies spanning multiple decades.

DCPA Evaluation: Criterion 1 (Custody Chain) â€” SATISFIED. Complete documented chain from original sequencing instruments through institutional repositories to consortium archive. Every data transfer logged with cryptographic verification. GEAA-admissible provenance for entire collection. Criterion 2 (Format Independence) â€” SATISFIED. Genomic data stored in open formats (FASTQ, BAM, VCF) with publicly documented specifications maintained by international standards bodies. Legacy proprietary formats from early sequencing platforms converted to open standards with conversion logs preserved. Criterion 3 (Geographic Redundancy) â€” SATISFIED. Primary: AWS us-east (Virginia). Secondary: Google Cloud europe-west (Netherlands). Tertiary: On-premise tape archive at consortium headquarters (San Francisco). Cold storage: Iron Mountain facility (Pennsylvania). Four locations across two countries, three vendors, two technology types (cloud + offline). Criterion 4 (Platform Diversification) â€” SATISFIED. AWS (38%), Google Cloud (34%), on-premise (18%), Iron Mountain (10%). No vendor exceeds 40% threshold. Criterion 5 (Migration Protocol) â€” SATISFIED. Full platform migration tested in 2023 when consortium moved 800TB from deprecated Azure environment to Google Cloud over 6-month period. Zero data loss confirmed through SHA-256 verification of every file. Migration documented as reference procedure. Criterion 6 (Integrity) â€” SATISFIED. SHA-256 checksums computed at ingest and verified weekly. 14 bit rot incidents detected and repaired from redundant copies over 28-year history. Zero permanent data loss. Criterion 7 (Funding) â€” SATISFIED. $340M endowment generating $13.6M annually (4% draw). Annual custody costs: $8.2M (storage $4.1M, personnel $2.4M, technology $1.7M). Surplus allocated to reserves. Cambridge Associates certification of perpetual adequacy under 2008-level stress scenario. Criterion 8 (Escrow) â€” SATISFIED. Complete archive replicated to Library of Congress digital preservation facility under cooperative agreement. Annual failover test: 2024 test recovered 50TB subset within 18 hours. Criterion 9 (Metadata) â€” SATISFIED. Dublin Core + domain-specific genomic metadata (sample origin, sequencing platform, quality metrics, research context). All metadata migrated with data. Criterion 10 (Institutional Infrastructure) â€” SATISFIED. Consortium organized as perpetual nonprofit with 12-member board including NIH representative. Professional archival staff (8 FTE). Annual audit by Digital Preservation Coalition.

Determination: PERPETUAL. All ten criteria satisfied without deficiency. Certificate issued with 5-year validity.

Institutional Impact: NIH accepts DCPA certificate as evidence of compliance with data sharing mandate â€” reducing consortium's annual compliance audit burden by approximately $450,000 and eliminating redundant technical reviews by individual grant-funded projects. Three pharmaceutical companies execute $28M data licensing agreements citing DCPA certification as key due diligence factor; prior licensees had required independent technical audits costing $200K+ each, so DCPA certification eliminates $600K in redundant due diligence annually across three licensees. GCRA enables data-backed research bonds at 180 basis points below uncertified data portfolios â€” saving approximately $2.4M annually on a $135M data preservation bond issuance. 47 research institutions add DCPA certification requirements to their data sharing agreements, establishing DCPA as emerging standard for genomic data perpetuity. The consortium's 28-year unbroken custody chain â€” verified through DCPA evaluation â€” becomes a competitive advantage, as newer genomic archives without comparable provenance cannot achieve PERPETUAL certification until they accumulate sufficient operational history demonstrating sustained custody commitment.

Case Study 2: Municipal Records â€” NOT PERPETUAL

Scenario: City of Westfield (fictional), population 180,000, seeks DCPA PERPETUAL certification for its 2.8TB municipal records archive including property records (dating to 1847 digitization), court records (1960-present), building permits (1975-present), and public meeting recordings (2008-present). The city attorney's office has recommended certification following a state audit finding that the city's digital records preservation does not meet emerging best practices.

DCPA Evaluation: Criterion 1 â€” SATISFIED (complete chain from digitization through current IT custody, well-documented by city IT department). Criterion 2 â€” NOT SATISFIED. Property records stored in proprietary database format (legacy municipal software vendor CivicPro, acquired by larger company in 2019). Export capabilities limited to PDF print â€” losing all structured data, search functionality, and relational links between parcels, owners, and transactions. No conversion procedure to open format documented. The acquiring company has already discontinued two of CivicPro's product lines since acquisition, creating format abandonment risk. Criterion 3 â€” NOT SATISFIED. All data stored in single municipal data center located in city hall basement, a flood zone rated for 100-year flood events. No geographic redundancy. Backup tapes stored in adjacent room (same building, same flood zone). Criterion 4 â€” NOT SATISFIED. All data on single VMware environment with NetApp storage in city data center. Zero platform diversification. Single vendor dependency for both compute and storage. Criterion 5 â€” SATISFIED (IT staff has conducted test migrations for non-proprietary data formats). Criterion 6 â€” SATISFIED (SHA-256 checksums computed on weekly cycle). Criterion 7 â€” NOT SATISFIED. No endowment or dedicated preservation fund. Custody funded through annual IT budget subject to city council appropriation. Budget was cut 15% in 2023 fiscal year due to revenue shortfall â€” directly impacting data preservation capacity. IT director confirmed that migration projects have been deferred three consecutive years due to budget constraints. Criterion 8 â€” NOT SATISFIED. No escrow arrangement. If municipal data center suffers catastrophic failure (fire, flood, earthquake), no independent copy exists outside the building. Criterion 9 â€” SATISFIED (metadata reasonably maintained). Criterion 10 â€” PARTIALLY SATISFIED but insufficient. IT department manages data custody as secondary responsibility to 47 other IT functions. No dedicated archival staff. No independent audit.

Determination: NOT PERPETUAL. Five of ten criteria not satisfied plus one partially satisfied. Critical deficiencies in format independence, geographic redundancy, platform diversification, perpetual funding, and escrow protection.

Remediation Recommendations: (1) Migrate property records from proprietary CivicPro format to open relational database (PostgreSQL) or standardized municipal data schema â€” estimated 6-month project at $180K; (2) Establish geographic redundancy through state-operated municipal data backup consortium (several states operate such programs at $2-5K annually per municipality) or commercial cloud secondary storage; (3) Diversify platforms â€” add cloud tier (AWS GovCloud or Azure Government) for secondary storage at approximately $800/month for 2.8TB; (4) Establish municipal data preservation trust fund with initial capitalization from one-time budget allocation, bond issuance, or state digital preservation grant; (5) Execute escrow agreement with state archives or regional library consortium. Estimated total remediation: $420K capital investment plus $65K annual recurring â€” less than 0.1% of the city's annual operating budget to protect 177 years of irreplaceable community records.

Significance: Demonstrates that most municipal governments â€” despite managing irreplaceable public records spanning centuries â€” lack data custody infrastructure meeting perpetuity standards. The property records dating to 1847 represent the foundational documentation of every real property transaction in the community's history, stored in a proprietary format that a single vendor business decision could render inaccessible. A 100-year flood event would destroy the only copies of 177 years of community records. DCPA's NOT PERPETUAL determination, with specific cost estimates for remediation, enables the city to pursue preservation through its capital improvement process with quantified costs rather than vague IT modernization requests.

Case Study 3: Cloud-Native SaaS Company â€” Platform Independence

Scenario: DataVault Inc. (fictional), a $240M SaaS company providing regulatory compliance data management to 180 financial institutions, seeks DCPA INDEPENDENT certification. Clients are subject to SEC Rule 17a-4 requiring immutable record retention for 6 years and financial regulators have questioned DataVault's single-cloud architecture.

DCPA Evaluation: Criterion 1 (Multi-Platform) â€” NOT SATISFIED on initial evaluation. 100% of data on AWS with no secondary platform. Single availability zone failure in 2023 caused 4-hour outage affecting 23 clients. After receiving preliminary findings, DataVault implements remediation: adds Azure secondary (30% of data) and Wasabi cold storage (complete archive). Re-evaluation: SATISFIED. Criterion 2 (Export) â€” SATISFIED. Full export in standard formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet) with automated bulk export API. Tested quarterly. Criterion 3 (Format Portability) â€” SATISFIED. All data in open formats. Criterion 4 (Access Independence) â€” SATISFIED after remediation. Data accessible through standard SQL interfaces, REST APIs with documented specifications, and direct file download â€” no vendor-specific tools required. Criterion 5 (Failover) â€” SATISFIED after remediation. Automated failover to Azure tested: 2-hour RTO achieved (requirement: 24 hours). Zero data loss through real-time replication. Criterion 6 (Vendor Bankruptcy) â€” SATISFIED after remediation. With three-platform architecture, any single vendor failure survivable.

Determination: INDEPENDENT (after remediation). All six criteria satisfied. Certificate issued permanently for current architecture.

Institutional Impact: 23 financial institution clients that had previously required annual independent technical audits (total cost: $2.3M annually across all clients) accept DCPA INDEPENDENT certificate as equivalent assurance â€” eliminating redundant audit costs. DataVault uses certificate in enterprise sales process â€” reducing average sales cycle by 45 days as DCPA certification addresses the primary objection ("what if your platform goes down?") with third-party verified evidence rather than sales team assurances. Three prospective clients that had rejected DataVault specifically due to single-cloud architecture concerns sign contracts within 60 days of certification, generating $4.2M in new annual recurring revenue. SEC examination of DataVault's custody arrangements cites DCPA certificate as evidence of regulatory compliance with broker-dealer data accessibility requirements under Rule 17a-4.

The remediation process itself â€” implementing multi-platform architecture prompted by DCPA's initial NOT INDEPENDENT finding â€” improved DataVault's actual resilience. The 2023 single-AZ outage that affected 23 clients for 4 hours could not recur under the new architecture. DataVault's CTO characterized the DCPA evaluation as "the most valuable technical audit we've ever undergone â€” it identified the exact vulnerability our internal team had been arguing about for two years, and gave us the external authority to fund the fix."

Case Study 4: Cultural Heritage â€” Migration Readiness

Scenario: The Digital Humanities Archive (fictional), a university-affiliated archive managing 890TB of digitized manuscripts, oral histories, and born-digital literary works from 140 contributing institutions, seeks DCPA READY certification after a near-miss incident where a legacy storage system failure threatened 12TB of irreplaceable oral history recordings from Native American communities. The archive's advisory board mandated DCPA certification as condition for continued institutional support.

DCPA Evaluation: All seven migration readiness criteria evaluated. Criterion 1 (Planning) â€” SATISFIED. Comprehensive plan developed in response to near-miss incident, covering all 890TB across 47 distinct data types. Criterion 2 (Technical Capability) â€” SATISFIED. Two certified digital preservation specialists hired (both holding Digital Archives Specialist certification). Migration tools (Archivematica, BitCurator, custom scripts) validated through testing. Testing environments isolated from production. Criterion 3 (Format Conversion) â€” NOT SATISFIED initially. Archive contains 34TB in obsolete RealMedia format (oral histories recorded 2001-2008) with no documented conversion procedure. Additionally, 8TB in legacy Kodak Photo CD format (manuscript digitizations from 1998-2003) lacks verified conversion pathway. After 90-day remediation: custom FFmpeg pipeline developed and tested converting RealMedia to FLAC (audio) and MP4/H.265 (video) with metadata preservation. Kodak Photo CD conversion to TIFF validated through LibTIFF toolchain. Sample conversions verified by independent archivist confirming zero quality loss. Re-evaluation: SATISFIED. Criterion 4 â€” SATISFIED. Sample migrations completed for all 47 data types with documented results. Lessons learned document identifies three format-specific risks with implemented mitigations. Criterion 5 (Downtime Minimization) â€” SATISFIED. Phased migration approach ensures no data type offline for more than 48 hours. Criterion 6 (Financial Resources) â€” SATISFIED. $1.2M migration budget allocated from university digital preservation endowment. Criterion 7 (Stakeholder Communication) â€” SATISFIED. Communication plan developed for 140 contributing institutions. Training materials prepared for archive staff and researchers.

Determination: READY (after remediation). All criteria satisfied. Certificate issued with 3-year validity.

Significance: The near-miss incident that prompted DCPA evaluation revealed that the archive's 34TB of oral history recordings â€” many featuring elders who have since passed away, making the recordings literally irreplaceable â€” were stored in a format (RealMedia) that the original vendor (RealNetworks) has essentially abandoned. Without DCPA's structured evaluation forcing comprehensive format inventory, these recordings might have remained in obsolete format until the format became completely unreadable. The 90-day remediation window demonstrated DCPA's practical value: not just certification, but a structured process for identifying and resolving preservation risks before they cause permanent loss.

Institutional License (via IRUA): Unlimited evaluations $65,000+/year. Renewal: 50% of initial application.

Revenue Allocation: Evaluator Compensation (40%): Digital preservation specialists with OAIS certification, archival scientists, cloud architects with multi-cloud expertise, database engineers specializing in cross-platform migration, cybersecurity analysts with data protection focus, and format migration experts. Infrastructure Operations (20%): Application portal development and maintenance, certificate management system, SICA integration infrastructure, blockchain attestation automation, and verification portal. Expert Network (15%): Specialized consultation for novel storage technologies (DNA storage, glass-based storage, emerging persistent media), format obsolescence risk assessment, cold storage engineering, and endowment sustainability modeling. Quality Assurance (10%): Peer review of all determinations before issuance, consistency auditing across evaluation panels, calibration exercises ensuring uniform criteria application across data types and storage technologies. Operational Reserve (15%): 24-month operating expenses maintained as perpetual service obligation reserve ensuring evaluation capacity regardless of revenue fluctuations.

Financial Stress Test: DCPA must maintain operations at 80% revenue decline for minimum 24 months. Break-even: approximately 150 evaluations annually or 30 enterprise IRUA licenses. At break-even, evaluation timelines extend (100 business days for Perpetuity instead of 75) but criteria rigor and binary determinacy maintained without compromise.

7.2 Governance & Founder Irrelevance

Automated Operations: Application intake and completeness checking. Fee processing and payment confirmation. Certificate generation and Ed25519 digital signing. SICA registry recording and SHA3-512 hashing. Three-chain blockchain attestation (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Arweave). Renewal reminder processing and expiration management. Certificate verification portal. Optional integrity monitoring alerts for certified repositories (advisory notifications when public information suggests platform provider instability).

Human Operations (Requiring Professional Judgment): Custody chain verification and provenance authentication â€” determining whether documented chain meets GEAA admissibility standards and whether gaps are genuine breaks or merely documentation deficiencies. Format independence assessment â€” evaluating whether formats meet open standards criteria, whether specifications are sufficiently documented for long-term tool development, and whether conversion procedures preserve data fidelity. Geographic and platform diversification adequacy â€” assessing whether redundancy provides genuine independence versus shared infrastructure creating correlated failure risk. Migration protocol testing adequacy â€” reviewing test results, evaluating whether test scenarios are realistic, and assessing whether successful tests on sample data predict full-scale migration success. Perpetual funding sustainability analysis â€” evaluating endowment adequacy under stress scenarios, assessing spending rate sustainability, and verifying investment policy appropriateness. Escrow arrangement completeness â€” testing whether escrow activation procedures actually work and whether escrow data is current. Metadata preservation quality â€” assessing whether metadata is sufficient for future researchers to understand and use data without original creator assistance.

Operational Constraint: Maximum 6 hours monthly founder involvement during steady-state operations. All routine operations automated with exception-based escalation for novel data types, unprecedented storage technologies, or first-impression format obsolescence questions.

Delegation Structure: Data Custody Evaluation Committee â€” digital preservation professionals with minimum 15 years experience in archival science, digital preservation, or data management. Platform Independence Assessment Panel â€” cloud architects and infrastructure specialists with multi-vendor expertise. Migration Readiness Review Team â€” data engineers, format conversion specialists, and database migration practitioners. Quality Review Board â€” peer review of all determinations for consistency and criteria fidelity. Emerging Technology Advisory â€” monitors storage technology evolution (DNA storage, glass-based media, quantum memory) and recommends criteria updates through formal version succession process.

Founder Role Limited To: Emergency authority for unprecedented situations, strategic oversight (quarterly), succession planning, and constitutional amendments.

7.3 Succession & Perpetual Operations

Scenario â€” Founder Incapacity/Death: Detection at 30 days inactivity, succession activation at 90 days. Authority transfers to Continuity Trust. All automated systems continue without interruption. Certification criteria remain fixed. Previously issued certificates remain valid and verifiable through SICA custody infrastructure. Succession tested annually through simulated activation.

Scenario â€” MW Entity Dissolution: DCPA operational authority transfers to designated institutional conservatorship. Previously issued certificates remain permanent through blockchain attestation (survives entity dissolution). Evaluation capacity may reduce but existing certificates unaffected. Endowment funds perpetual verification operations for minimum 50 years.

Dead Man's Switch: Monthly cryptographic check-in. 90-day threshold triggers automatic succession. Prevents service gap from sudden personnel loss.

7.4 Expert Network

Specialists: Digital preservation scientists (OAIS reference model, format migration, long-term archiving strategies, emulation versus migration approaches). Cloud architects (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, multi-cloud design, hybrid infrastructure, geographic distribution strategies). Database engineers (relational migration, NoSQL transformation, time-series conversion, graph database portability). Cybersecurity analysts (data protection at rest and in transit, integrity monitoring, threat modeling for archival systems). Archival scientists (metadata standards â€” Dublin Core, METS, PREMIS â€” provenance documentation, custody chain methodology). Endowment sustainability analysts (perpetual funding modeling, investment strategy for preservation trusts, stress testing). Format specialists (audio/video preservation â€” FLAC, BWF, DPX; document formats â€” PDF/A, ODF; scientific formats â€” HDF5, NetCDF, FITS). Cold storage engineers (tape technologies â€” LTO, IBM TS; optical â€” M-DISC, Blu-ray archival; emerging â€” DNA storage, glass-based storage).

Engagement: Fee-based consultation included in evaluation fees. On-call for expedited evaluations. Annual re-certification with minimum 15-year experience for panel leads. Semi-annual technology horizon scan reviewing emerging storage and preservation technologies.

7.5 Cyber Threat Planning

Threats: Ransomware targeting archived data â€” particularly attractive because irreplaceable data creates maximum leverage for ransom demands. Supply chain attacks on cloud storage infrastructure affecting multiple certified repositories simultaneously. State-sponsored targeting of research data (genomic, defense-adjacent, energy). Insider threats from custodial staff with privileged access. Quantum computing threat to SHA-256 integrity verification â€” while SHA3-512 used for DCPA certificates is quantum-resistant, repository-level integrity verification often uses SHA-256 which may become vulnerable.

Mitigations: Air-gapped backup recommendations for certified repositories (advisory guidance in evaluation reports). Geographic distribution requirements embedded in criteria. Post-quantum hash algorithm migration guidance â€” DCPA will issue advisory when NIST PQC standards affect repository-level integrity verification. Bug bounty: $500 (low) to $10,000 (critical) for DCPA infrastructure vulnerabilities. Evaluation data encrypted at rest (AES-256) and deleted within 60 days of evaluation completion. All evaluation staff subject to background checks and confidentiality agreements protecting proprietary data architecture details submitted during evaluation.

VIII. WHY DCPA EXISTS (INSTITUTIONAL NECESSITY)

The Data Loss Problem: Most digital data is permanently lost within decades of creation. The scale of digital loss is staggering and accelerating. A landmark study found that 20% of URLs cited in Supreme Court opinions and 50% of URLs in law review articles were broken â€” digital link rot destroying access to legal scholarship at alarming rates. Google has discontinued 290+ products and services since 2006, each discontinuation potentially destroying user data. Yahoo permanently deleted all content from Yahoo Groups in 2020 â€” 18 years of community archives, discussion threads, and shared files representing millions of hours of human knowledge and communication, permanently lost. GeoCities' deletion in 2009 destroyed approximately 38 million user-created web pages. Vine's shutdown eliminated 6.5 years of video content.

Storage media physically degrades with mathematical certainty. Magnetic tape loses integrity within 15-30 years. Optical media (CD-R, DVD-R) degrades within 5-25 years depending on manufacturing quality and storage conditions. Hard disk drives have annual failure rates of 1-5%, meaning unmonitored drives have significant probability of complete failure within a decade. Even solid-state storage is subject to charge leakage causing bit flips over multi-year unpowered storage.

File formats become obsolete as vendors abandon products. WordPerfect files from the 1990s require specialized conversion. Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheets are unreadable by modern software without conversion tools that may themselves become unavailable. Proprietary database formats from defunct vendors trap data in inaccessible silos. Scientific data in obsolete instrument-specific formats loses accessibility as manufacturers discontinue products.

Without DCPA certification, institutions cannot distinguish truly perpetual custody arrangements from marketing claims. "Cloud storage" providers frequently terminate services, change terms, or increase prices; "enterprise backup" solutions depend on vendor viability; and "archival" claims lack objective verification. DCPA provides the first institutional mechanism for certifying that data will actually persist across generational timescales through verified infrastructure, tested procedures, and funded commitments.

The Platform Lock-In Problem: Data custody increasingly depends on specific platform providers creating dangerous single points of failure. Cloud migration studies report that 80% of organizations experience unexpected difficulty migrating between cloud providers, with average migration timelines exceeding initial estimates by 2-3x. Proprietary formats prevent migration â€” organizations storing data in vendor-specific formats discover that export capabilities are limited, deliberately crippled, or prohibitively expensive. Vendor-specific tools create access dependencies where losing a single vendor relationship means losing access to data. Switching costs are structured to prevent rational vendor changes, with some organizations reporting that migration costs exceed five years of incumbent vendor fees. The result: organizations cannot evaluate platform independence objectively, pricing increases cannot be resisted, and vendor failures cascade into data accessibility crises affecting entire institutional ecosystems.

The Migration Failure Problem: Data migration attempts frequently fail with severe consequences. Industry studies report that 38% of data migration projects exceed budget, 33% exceed timeline, and measurable data loss occurs in over 10% of major migrations. Failed migrations result from inadequate planning (no test environment, insufficient timeline), insufficient technical expertise (underestimated complexity), underfunding (migration abandoned mid-stream), metadata loss (data migrated but context destroyed making it unusable), and absent rollback procedures (failed migration leaves data in neither old nor new system). DCPA certifies migration readiness through rigorous testing requirements, ensuring custodians can execute technology transitions successfully before they become emergencies â€” when migration capability matters most.
