I. PREAMBLE & CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATION

1.1 Declaration of Purpose

The Eternal Publishing Authority (EPA) is constituted as the seventh constitutional authority within the MW Infrastructure Stack, established to govern the creation, distribution, and economic sustainability of long-form written worksâ€”books, monographs, treatises, and comprehensive intellectual contributionsâ€”that advance human knowledge and cultural understanding across generations.

EPA exists to solve a critical publishing problem: the absence of a comprehensive framework enabling authors to create intellectually rigorous, commercially viable, and culturally enduring written works without dependence on legacy publishing gatekeepers, platform algorithms, or short-term market trends that systematically suppress depth in favor of virality.

This Constitution establishes EPA as the canonical authority for publishing standards, providing authorsâ€”scholars, researchers, journalists, essayists, novelists, and public intellectualsâ€”with methodologies for producing works that achieve intellectual substance, economic sustainability, and multigenerational relevance through systematic craft development, strategic publishing decisions, and audience cultivation.

The authority derives its power from synthesis of literary craft tradition, publishing economics, intellectual property strategy, audience psychology, and historical analysis of enduring intellectual contributionsâ€”not from commercial publishing conventions, marketing mythology, or platform-driven content strategies.

1.2 The Publishing Degradation Crisis

Contemporary publishing suffers from systematic devaluation of substantive intellectual work:

**Gatekeeping Capture:** Traditional publishing consolidates into five major conglomerates controlling market access. Publishers prioritize blockbuster potential over intellectual merit, celebrity platforms over unknown talent, safe commercial bets over innovative thinking. The midlistâ€”competent writers producing intellectually serious work without celebrity statusâ€”has been systematically eliminated.

**Platformization Pressure:** Digital platforms (Medium, Substack, Twitter) reward short-form, frequent content optimized for algorithmic distribution. Writers who could produce significant books instead produce endless blog posts, tweets, and newsletters that generate immediate engagement but lack lasting intellectual value. Thought becomes fragmented, discourse becomes shallow, intellectual architecture becomes impossible.

**Economic Unsustainability:** Book advances have collapsed for non-celebrity authors. Average advance for first-time authors: $5,000-$15,000. Time to write serious book: 1-5 years. Economics force authors to choose between intellectual ambition and economic survival. Those who choose books accept poverty; those who choose survival abandon books.

**Attention Fragmentation:** Reader attention has fractured across infinite digital distractions. Long-form reading becomes rare. Publishers respond by demanding shorter books, simpler language, more frequent publications. Intellectual complexity becomes commercial liability. Authors self-censor complexity to access markets.

**Discovery Collapse:** Online bookstores (Amazon dominates 50%+ of market) use algorithmic recommendation favoring high-volume sellers, recent releases, and paid promotion. Quality signals collapse. Excellent unknown books become invisible. Authors must choose between intellectual integrity and discoverability-driven compromise.

**Rights Exploitation:** Publishing contracts routinely demand all rights (print, ebook, audio, translation, film) in perpetuity for single advance payment. Authors surrender lifetime value for upfront poverty wages. Rights never revert. Authors cannot re-negotiate as works appreciate. Publishers extract all value; authors receive minimal compensation.

**Format Ephemerality:** Ebooks tied to proprietary platforms (Kindle, Apple Books) create format lock-in and potential inaccessibility. DRM prevents preservation. Platform closures erase purchased libraries. Physical books face poor paper quality, cheap binding, rapid degradation. Works vanish within decades despite digital immortality potential.

**Intellectual Homogenization:** Market pressure creates intellectual conformity. Publishers want proven formulas, familiar genres, safe perspectives. Innovative thinking becomes commercially risky. Controversial ideas become unpublishable. Intellectual diversity collapses into algorithmic sameness.

EPA eliminates these failure modes by providing frameworks for creating publishable works outside gatekeeping systems, building sustainable author economics, preserving intellectual property rights, and ensuring multigenerational accessibility.

1.3 Constitutional Scope & Authority Boundaries

EPA operates exclusively within the following constitutional boundaries:

**Publishing Standards:** EPA issues canonical standards for long-form writing across genresâ€”narrative nonfiction, scholarly works, literary fiction, public intellectual contribution, investigative journalism, technical documentation, philosophical treatises.

**Economic Frameworks:** EPA provides authors with business models enabling sustainable income from books without dependency on advances, celebrity platforms, or constant content production.

**Distribution Strategy:** EPA establishes methodologies for reaching readers through multiple channelsâ€”traditional publishing, direct publishing, hybrid approachesâ€”maximizing author control and economic return.

**Intellectual Property:** EPA defines rights management strategies ensuring authors retain control and benefit from their works across formats, languages, and timeframes.

**Craft Development:** EPA synthesizes writing craft knowledge enabling authors to produce works meeting publication standards across technical execution, structural coherence, and intellectual substance.

EPA explicitly does NOT:
* Provide manuscript evaluation or editing services
* Guarantee publication or commercial success
* Offer literary agent representation or publishing deals
* Replace professional editing, design, or production services
* Curate or select which works merit publication
* Provide legal advice regarding contracts or intellectual property
* Operate as publisher or distribution platform
* Certify works as "important" or "lasting"

These exclusions maintain EPA's role as knowledge infrastructure rather than publishing services provider.

1.4 Relationship to MW Canon & Coordinate Authorities

EPA operates under absolute subordination to the MW Canon (MW-Î©âºâºâºâºâº) and in coordination with other MW authorities.

**MW Canon Subordination:** EPA complies with all MW Canon principles including founder irrelevance, document-bound authority, payment-as-contract, no customer support, and canonical hosting requirements.

**IRUA Coordination:** EPA frameworks are licensed through IRUA's institutional licensing framework. Authors and institutions access EPA via IRUA licenses.

**GEAA Coordination:** EPA contracts and documentation follow GEAA evidentiary standards, ensuring publishing agreements and rights documentation are legally admissible.

**EWA Coordination:** EPA works submitted to EWA preservation infrastructure receive cultural longevity archival. EPA focuses on creation and distribution; EWA ensures preservation.

**PMOA Coordination:** EPA craft development protocols integrate with PMOA mastery frameworks for author skill development.

**GCPA Coordination:** EPA economic models align with GCPA investment principles for author wealth building through intellectual property.

**Operational Independence:** While licensing flows through IRUA and preservation through EWA, EPA maintains independent constitutional authority over publishing standards.

1.5 Contract Verification & Rights Protection

EPA implements cryptographic contract verification and rights management:

**Contract Attestation:**
Publishing contracts blockchain-attested for:
- Immutable record of agreement terms
- Proof of rights ownership and transfers
- Verification of reversion triggers
- Documentation of subsidiary rights sales

Contract Hash Protocol:
```
Contract ID: EPA-CONTRACT-2025-001234
Parties: Author Name + Publisher/Platform Name
Contract Type: Traditional | Hybrid | Direct | Foreign Rights
Rights Granted: [Specific enumeration]
Duration: [Term length] | Life of Copyright | Until Reversion
Reversion Triggers: [Out of print | Sales threshold | Time period]
Hash: SHA3-512(complete_contract_text)
Author Signature: Ed25519_Sign(author_key, contract_hash)
Publisher Signature: Ed25519_Sign(publisher_key, contract_hash)
Blockchain Attestation: [ETH_tx | BTC_timestamp | Arweave_tx]
Execution Date: [ISO-8601]
```

**Rights Registry:**
EPA maintains blockchain-verified rights registry:
- Which rights author retains (audio, foreign, film, etc.)
- Which rights are licensed (and to whom, for how long)
- Reversion status (has out-of-print triggered? rights reverted?)
- Subsidiary deals (foreign editions, translations, adaptations)

Authors can prove rights ownership cryptographically, preventing publisher over-reach and enabling clean rights transactions.

**Reversion Automation:**
Smart contracts trigger automatic rights reversion when conditions met:
- Book out of print for specified period (6-24 months typical)
- Sales below threshold (e.g., <100 copies/year for 2 years)
- Publisher bankruptcy or acquisition
- Contract term expiration

No publisher permission requiredâ€”blockchain verifies conditions, rights automatically revert to author.

II. PUBLISHING PATHWAY FRAMEWORK

2.1 The Three Publishing Models

EPA recognizes three viable publishing pathways, each with distinct economics, control, and distribution characteristics:

**Model 1: Traditional Publishing**

Process:
- Author completes manuscript
- Literary agent submits to publishers
- Publisher offers contract (advance against royalties)
- Publisher handles editing, design, production, distribution, marketing
- Author receives royalties after advance earns out

Economics:
- Advance: $5,000-$100,000+ (median: $15,000 for first-time authors)
- Royalties: 10-15% hardcover, 7.5% paperback, 25% ebook (of net receipts)
- Earn-out rate: ~30% of books earn out advances
- Author income timeline: Advance on signing and delivery, royalties if/when earned out

Rights:
- Publisher typically demands: All English-language rights, potentially world rights
- Duration: Life of copyright or until book declared out-of-print
- Reversion: Possible after book out-of-print for specified period (typically 1-2 years)

Control:
- Editorial: Publisher has final say on content, title, cover, format
- Timing: Publisher controls publication date (typically 12-24 months after acceptance)
- Marketing: Publisher allocates marketing budget (often minimal for non-lead titles)

Distribution:
- Bookstore placement: Publisher has distribution relationships
- Library sales: Publisher has institutional sales channels
- International: Publisher may license foreign editions
- Prestige: Traditional publishing carries cultural legitimacy

Best For:
- Authors seeking cultural legitimacy and institutional credibility
- Works benefiting from editorial expertise and production quality
- Authors willing to trade control for distribution access
- Nonfiction requiring fact-checking and legal review
- Works where advance enables completion (research costs, living expenses)

**Model 2: Direct Publishing (Self-Publishing)**

Process:
- Author completes manuscript
- Author hires freelance professionals (editor, designer, formatter)
- Author uploads to platforms (Amazon KDP, IngramSpark, Draft2Digital)
- Author handles all marketing and promotion
- Author receives royalties monthly

Economics:
- Upfront costs: $2,000-$10,000 (editing, cover design, formatting, ISBN)
- Royalties: 35-70% depending on platform and pricing
- No advance: All income from sales
- Author income timeline: Monthly payments once sales begin
- Profit threshold: Lower than traditional (author keeps higher percentage)

Rights:
- Author retains: All rights across all formats and languages
- Duration: Author controls indefinitely
- Flexibility: Can license rights separately (audio, foreign, film)

Control:
- Editorial: Complete creative control
- Timing: Publish on author's schedule
- Design: Author chooses cover, format, pricing
- Marketing: Author controls all promotion

Distribution:
- Online: Amazon (KDP), Apple Books, Kobo, Google Play
- Print: Print-on-demand (KDP Print, IngramSpark)
- Libraries: Limited (IngramSpark provides library distribution)
- Bookstores: Difficult (require returnable inventory, distributor relationships)

Best For:
- Authors with existing audience (email list, social media following)
- Niche topics traditional publishers won't acquire
- Authors prioritizing speed to market
- Authors wanting maximum control and rights retention
- Authors comfortable with marketing and business operations

**Model 3: Hybrid Publishing**

Process:
- Combines elements of traditional and direct publishing
- Multiple variations: Partnership publishers, platform-exclusive deals, Kickstarter-funded

Economics:
- Variable: Some offer small advances + higher royalties, others no advance + 50% royalties
- Upfront costs: Some require author investment, others do not
- Royalty rates: Typically 40-50% (higher than traditional, lower than pure self-pub)

Rights:
- Negotiable: More favorable than traditional, less than direct
- Often time-limited (5-10 year license, then reversion)

Examples:
- Amazon Publishing (Montlake, Thomas & Mercer, etc.)
- Substack books (platform-native publishing)
- Kickstarter-funded (crowdfund production, self-distribute)

Best For:
- Authors wanting distribution help without surrendering all rights
- Platform-native content (Substack newsletters â†’ Substack books)
- Experimental economics (revenue sharing, profit participation)

2.2 Contract Analysis & Red Flags

EPA provides contract analysis frameworks identifying exploitative terms:

**Critical Contract Terms:**

Rights Granted:
- âœ… GOOD: "English-language print and ebook rights in North America for 7 years"
- âŒ BAD: "All rights in perpetuity throughout the universe"
- RED FLAG: "World rights" when publisher has no foreign distribution
- RED FLAG: Film/TV rights included without separate payment

Royalty Structure:
- âœ… GOOD: Royalties on cover price (gross receipts)
- âŒ BAD: Royalties on net receipts (after retailer discount, publisher deductions)
- RED FLAG: Escalating royalties that never trigger (e.g., "15% after 50,000 copies" for unknown author)
- RED FLAG: Different rates for different retailers (favors publisher-owned channels)

Advance & Payment:
- âœ… GOOD: 50% on signing, 50% on delivery and acceptance
- âŒ BAD: 33% on signing, 33% on delivery, 33% on publication (last payment delayed 12-24 months)
- RED FLAG: Advance split over multiple books (cross-collateralized)
- RED FLAG: "Acceptable to publisher" language (unlimited rejection power)

Out-of-Print & Reversion:
- âœ… GOOD: "Out of print = <500 copies sold in trailing 12 months; rights revert within 60 days of written request"
- âŒ BAD: "Out of print = not available in any format" (ebook sales of 10/year keeps rights locked)
- RED FLAG: No reversion clause
- RED FLAG: Reversion requires publisher permission

Non-Compete:
- âœ… GOOD: "Author will not publish substantially similar book during term"
- âŒ BAD: "Author will not publish any book without publisher approval"
- RED FLAG: Non-compete extends beyond contract term
- RED FLAG: Publisher has right of first refusal on all future works

Option Clause:
- âœ… GOOD: None, or "Publisher gets 30-day exclusive look at next book proposal"
- âŒ BAD: "Publisher gets exclusive right to acquire next two books on same terms"
- RED FLAG: Option on "next work" without genre limitation
- RED FLAG: Matching rights (can match any other offer)

**EPA Contract Review Protocol:**

Step 1 â€” Initial Red Flag Scan (Author self-check):
- Does contract grant "all rights"? â†’ REJECT or negotiate
- Is there no reversion clause? â†’ REJECT or negotiate
- Are royalties on net receipts? â†’ Negotiate or walk away
- Is advance split over 3+ payments? â†’ Negotiate or accept with caution

Step 2 â€” Professional Review (Recommended):
- Publishing attorney review ($500-$2,000)
- Agent review (if agented deal)
- Authors Guild contract review (members only, free)

Step 3 â€” Negotiation (If contract has fixable issues):
- Request reversion clause if absent
- Negotiate advance structure (fewer payments, faster payment)
- Limit rights grant (retain audio, foreign, film if possible)
- Shorten contract term or expand out-of-print definition

Step 4 â€” Decision:
- Accept: Contract is fair or best available option
- Walk away: Contract is exploitative and non-negotiable
- Counter-offer: Submit revised terms

**Common Negotiation Wins:**
- Audio rights reversion: Publishers often concede if author has platform for audiobook
- Foreign rights retention: If publisher lacks foreign distribution
- Reversion after 5-7 years: Instead of life of copyright
- Higher advance: If multiple publishers competing
- Higher royalty escalators: Better terms after sales thresholds

2.3 ISBN, Copyright & Legal Infrastructure

**ISBN (International Standard Book Number):**

What It Is:
- Unique identifier for books (like barcode/SKU)
- Different ISBN for each format (hardcover, paperback, ebook different ISBNs)
- Different ISBN for each edition (revised edition gets new ISBN)

When Required:
- Print books sold in bookstores, libraries â†’ REQUIRED
- Ebooks sold on Amazon â†’ Optional (Amazon assigns ASIN)
- Ebooks on other platforms (Apple, Kobo) â†’ REQUIRED

How to Obtain:
- Bowker (official US ISBN agency): $125 for 1, $295 for 10, $575 for 100
- Free from KDP/Draft2Digital â†’ But ISBN lists Amazon/D2D as publisher (not author)
- EPA Recommendation: Buy your own ($295 for 10 ISBNs, sufficient for most authors)

Where ISBN Appears:
- Back cover barcode
- Copyright page
- Metadata submitted to retailers and libraries

**Copyright Registration:**

Automatic Protection:
- Copyright exists automatically upon creation (no registration required)
- Protection: Life of author + 70 years (US), similar internationally

Registration Benefits (US):
- Prerequisite for filing infringement lawsuit in US courts
- Statutory damages available ($750-$30,000 per infringement, up to $150,000 if willful)
- Attorney fees recoverable if registered before infringement
- Public record of copyright ownership

How to Register:
- US Copyright Office: copyright.gov/registration
- Fee: $65 for single work (online registration)
- Timeline: Submit completed work + fee; registration takes 3-12 months
- Required materials: Completed work (upload), author information, publication date

EPA Recommendation: Register all commercially published works within 3 months of publication (maximizes infringement protections).

**Plagiarism Detection & Response:**

Prevention:
- Copyright registration (establishes priority)
- Publication date documentation (blockchain attestation via EWA)
- Unique phrasing and ideas (harder to plagiarize than generic content)

Detection:
- Google alerts for unique phrases from your work
- Copyscape, Grammarly plagiarism checker
- Reader reports (fans often find plagiarism)

Response Protocol:
1. Document infringement (screenshots, archives, purchase proof)
2. Send DMCA takedown notice to platform (Amazon, etc.)
3. Contact infringer directly (cease-and-desist letter)
4. Legal action if infringement substantial and profitable (consult attorney)

Most plagiarism resolves with DMCA notice; litigation rare and expensive.

2.4 Publishing Platform Strategy

**Amazon KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing):**

Advantages:
- Largest market share (65%+ of ebook sales, 40%+ of print)
- Easiest entry (account setup in minutes)
- Print-on-demand (no upfront costs)
- Fast payment (monthly, 60-day lag)

Disadvantages:
- Exclusivity requirement for KDP Select (70% royalty)
- Algorithmic opacity (book visibility unpredictable)
- Limited discovery (millions of books, high competition)
- Price restrictions (70% royalty only for $2.99-$9.99 ebooks)

EPA Strategy:
- Launch on KDP for initial sales and reviews
- Use KDP Select 90-day exclusivity for promotional tools (free days, Countdown Deals)
- After 90 days, decide: renew Select OR go wide (other platforms)

**IngramSpark (Print-on-Demand + Distribution):**

Advantages:
- Library and bookstore distribution (Baker & Taylor, Ingram)
- Returnable print (bookstores won't stock non-returnable)
- Global distribution (200+ countries)
- Higher royalties for direct sales

Disadvantages:
- Setup fees ($49 per title for print, $25 for ebook)
- Steeper learning curve (formatting more precise)
- Returns risk (returnability = books may come back unsold)

EPA Strategy:
- Use for print books if targeting libraries, bookstores
- Essential for academic, professional, reference works
- Skip if ebook-only or direct-to-reader sales model

**Draft2Digital (Aggregator):**

Advantages:
- Distributes to Apple Books, Kobo, Barnes & Noble, libraries (OverDrive)
- No exclusivity required
- Simple formatting (easier than direct uploads)
- Consolidated royalty reporting

Disadvantages:
- Slightly lower royalties (D2D takes small percentage)
- Less control than direct platform uploads

EPA Strategy:
- Use for "going wide" (multi-platform distribution)
- Simplifies non-Amazon distribution

**Substack (Newsletter + Book Integration):**

Advantages:
- Built-in audience (newsletter subscribers)
- Direct relationship with readers
- Email list ownership (portable if you leave)
- Serialized book publication (chapters as posts)

Disadvantages:
- Limited reach beyond existing subscribers
- Platform dependency (Substack owns distribution)
- Still emerging book publishing features

EPA Strategy:
- Build audience via newsletter first (12-24 months)
- Serialize book chapters for subscribers
- Compile into book (offer as paid download or publish via KDP)

2.5 Marketing & Launch Strategy

EPA marketing framework based on platform building, not paid advertising:

**Pre-Launch (6-12 Months Before Publication):**

Build Email List:
- Goal: 1,000+ subscribers before launch (3,000+ optimal)
- Methods: Free chapter, resource library, weekly essays
- Platform: ConvertKit, Substack, MailChimp
- Cadence: Weekly emails maintaining engagement

Advance Reader Team:
- Goal: 50-100 committed readers who will review on launch day
- Recruitment: Email list, social media, writing community
- Offer: Free advance copy in exchange for honest review
- Timeline: Distribute 4-6 weeks before launch

Platform Presence:
- Choose primary platform (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok)
- Consistent posting (3-5x per week) building authority
- Share research, ideas, behind-the-scenes of book writing
- Goal: Demonstrate expertise, build anticipation

**Launch Week (Week of Publication):**

Amazon Algorithm Optimization:
- Concentrate sales in first 7 days (Amazon ranks books by velocity)
- Email list: 3 emails (announcement, reminder, last chance)
- Social media: Daily posts
- Goal: 100+ sales in first week (triggers "Hot New Release" badge)

Review Acquisition:
- Advance readers post reviews on launch day
- Goal: 15+ reviews in first week (Amazon visibility threshold)
- Follow-up emails to non-reviewers (gentle reminder)

Price Strategy:
- Launch at 99Â¢ for 3-5 days (maximizes sales volume, reviews)
- Increase to $2.99-$4.99 after launch spike
- Occasional promotions (drive new reviews, sales spikes)

**Post-Launch (Ongoing):**

Consistent Content:
- Continue newsletter (book readers join email list)
- Regular social media (stay visible to audience)
- Podcast interviews (reach new audiences)

Amazon Advertising (Optional):
- Start small ($5-10/day)
- Target keywords related to book topic
- Monitor ROI (stop if not profitable within 30 days)

Organic Discovery:
- Word-of-mouth (best marketing, occurs if book is excellent)
- Book clubs (seed copies to influential clubs)
- Media coverage (pitch to podcasts, blogs, traditional media if relevant)

Long-Tail Sales:
- Books sell for years if content remains relevant
- Focus on evergreen topics, not trending controversies
- Build backlist (multiple books cross-promote)
