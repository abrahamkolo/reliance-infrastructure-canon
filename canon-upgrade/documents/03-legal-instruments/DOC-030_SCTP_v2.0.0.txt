I. PURPOSE AND SCOPE

This Protocol establishes the deterministic mechanisms ensuring uninterrupted MW Infrastructure Stack operation across unlimited time horizons â€” including founder death, incapacitation, organizational dissolution, and catastrophic institutional failure. The Protocol eliminates person-dependent continuity risks through automated succession triggers, cryptographic authority transfer, and institutional redundancy systems.

The Protocol applies to all MW governance functions, document custody responsibilities, certification authority operations, and financial control mechanisms. It operates independently of human intention, testamentary instruments, or organizational decision-making processes.

All succession events execute according to binary triggers verifiable through objective evidence. No discretionary determination of succession timing, successor qualification, or authority scope occurs. The system maintains institutional-grade continuity through pre-specified conditional logic resistant to capture, manipulation, or political interference.

This Protocol binds all MW authorities, successor entities, and reliant institutions. Deviation from specified succession requirements constitutes grounds for immediate disqualification and institutional rejection of purported successor claims.

1.1 Relationship to MW Canon & Coordinate Documents

Document 21 (CSCA): Defines contractual succession continuity â€” how licensee contracts survive succession. SCTP defines the succession mechanism itself; CSCA ensures downstream contractual obligations survive intact.

Document 27 (CCOCP): Defines custody protocol. Succession events constitute custody transfers for all artifacts under predecessor's custody â€” SCTP succession triggers CCOCP custody transfer procedures for every artifact.

Document 28 (RAS): Registry records succession events as entry types. Authority transfer entries permanently record the succession trigger, verification evidence, and successor identity in the immutable hash chain.

Document 29 (MJMP): Mirror infrastructure continues operating during succession. MJMP's automated failover ensures document availability is unaffected regardless of succession status.

SICA Integration: All authority transfers blockchain-attested on three chains (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Arweave). Key revocations and new key registrations published to all three chains, creating independently verifiable proof of legitimate authority transfer.

Legal Framework: Delaware Statutory Trust Act (trust formation and governance). Delaware DGCL (successor entity operations). UETA, E-SIGN (electronic authority transfer validity). New York Convention (international enforcement of succession-related arbitration). ICC arbitration (Zurich seat) per IATA for succession disputes.

II. FOUNDER IRRELEVANCE FRAMEWORK

2.1 Operational Independence

The MW Infrastructure Stack operates with complete founder irrelevance from initial deployment. System architecture prohibits founder discretion in: certification decisions (binary per Document 25 BDTM); document interpretation (deterministic per Document 3); fee determination (formulaic per Document 5); and institutional qualification assessments (objective criteria per authority constitutions).

Founder involvement is limited to four categories of pre-scripted activity: (1) Technical maintenance â€” infrastructure monitoring, security patching, performance optimization â€” none of which affects canonical content or certification logic. (2) Crisis response â€” extraordinary intervention during catastrophic failures threatening system integrity, executed per documented emergency protocols. (3) Legal compliance â€” mandatory regulatory filings and government reporting. (4) Financial administration â€” payment processing oversight and tax compliance. All activities execute according to predetermined protocols admitting no discretionary deviation. Founder actions outside these boundaries trigger automatic audit and potential system override through successor activation.

2.2 Knowledge Transfer Elimination

The Protocol requires zero knowledge transfer from founder to successors. Complete system documentation exists in canonical form accessible to any qualified successor without founder mediation. Documentation completeness mandate: technical architecture (network topology, security controls, monitoring, operational procedures); financial systems (payment flows, revenue allocation, compliance reporting); legal framework (jurisdiction analysis, regulatory matrices, enforcement procedures); and operational runbooks (step-by-step for routine operations, incident response, emergency protocols). Documentation gaps triggering succession complications constitute system defects requiring immediate remediation. This is not aspirational â€” it is a binding architectural requirement.

2.3 Relationship Independence

System operation prohibits reliance on founder relationships with external parties. All external relationships transfer automatically through contractual provisions requiring: automatic assignment clauses (transfer without counterparty consent); relationship continuity (continued service under identical terms); complete knowledge base access; and non-discrimination (no service degradation based on entity identity). External parties refusing portability face immediate replacement through automated vendor substitution.

III. SUCCESSION TRIGGER FRAMEWORK

3.1 Automatic Trigger Categories

Succession activates automatically â€” without human judgment, committee deliberation, or board vote â€” upon occurrence of any trigger in four categories:

Category 1 â€” Biological Triggers: Death certification (legal death certificate in any jurisdiction). Incapacitation declaration (court determination of mental or physical incapacity lasting minimum 90 consecutive days). Disappearance (absence of verifiable founder communication for continuous 180-day period).

Category 2 â€” Legal Triggers: Criminal conviction (final felony conviction with sentence exceeding 1 year). Bankruptcy filing (personal or business, voluntary or involuntary, in any jurisdiction). Sanctions designation (OFAC SDN, UN sanctions, EU restrictive measures â€” single designation triggers immediate activation).

Category 3 â€” Operational Triggers: Abandonment (failure to execute mandatory quarterly system verification for 90 consecutive days â€” missing 3 consecutive quarterly checks). Breach of protocol (documented violation of founder role limitations per Section 2.1 exceeding materiality threshold). Fiduciary violation (misappropriation of institutional funds or unauthorized fee modifications).

Category 4 â€” Voluntary Triggers: Resignation declaration (Ed25519-signed statement of permanent role termination with two-factor confirmation). Succession request (formal petition citing health, personal, or strategic considerations).

All triggers activate through objective verification â€” no subjective assessment of founder fitness, capability, or intent.

3.2 Trigger Verification Mechanisms

Each trigger employs specific verification infrastructure:

Death: Automated monitoring of government vital records databases in founder domicile jurisdiction plus global death notice publications. Verification requires government-issued death certificate with Hague Apostille for international recognition.

Incapacitation: Court order monitoring in all jurisdictions of legal residence or business operations. Accepts guardianship, conservatorship, or medical incapacity declarations from courts of competent jurisdiction.

Disappearance: Automated tracking of digital activity (email responsiveness, system logins, financial transactions, public communications). 180-day absence of any tracked activity triggers automatic succession.

Criminal conviction: Real-time court record database monitoring. Requires final conviction with appeal rights exhausted or deadline expired.

Bankruptcy: PACER monitoring (U.S.) plus international insolvency registry tracking. Accepts petitions in any jurisdiction.

Sanctions: Daily monitoring of OFAC, UN, and EU sanctions lists. Single designation = immediate activation (no grace period â€” sanctions regimes prohibit continued commercial activity).

Abandonment: Automated logging of quarterly verification submissions. Three consecutive misses = automatic determination.

Breach/Fiduciary: Continuous monitoring of founder actions and financial transactions. Automated detection triggers immediate succession plus fund recovery.

Voluntary: Ed25519 signature validation against registered founder keys plus two-factor authentication. Blockchain-attested upon execution.

IV. SUCCESSOR ENTITY STRUCTURE

4.1 Primary Successor: Continuity Trust

Continuity Trust operates as perpetual purpose trust under Delaware Statutory Trust Act with sole purpose of MW Infrastructure Stack stewardship. Formation precedes public deployment â€” the trust exists and is operational before the system goes live.

Trust instrument establishes: irrevocable commitment to Protocol compliance; prohibition on discretionary modification of canonical documents; fiduciary obligation to institutional reliance preservation; and specific prohibition on trust termination absent complete Protocol compliance impossibility.

Governance structure: (1) Institutional Trustee â€” Delaware trust company, licensed and bonded, minimum $100M fiduciary liability insurance, annual SOC 2 Type II audit. (2) Trust Protector â€” independent oversight with authority to remove and replace trustee for Protocol violations (but no authority to modify canonical documents, fee structures, or certification criteria). (3) Technical Operator â€” entity responsible for infrastructure maintenance under trustee supervision, selected through competitive qualification process. (4) Advisory Board â€” non-voting technical and legal advisors providing expertise without decision-making authority.

All governance roles operate under strict Protocol compliance obligations with automatic removal for violations. No governance role possesses authority to modify the canonical document stack, alter certification logic, change fee formulas, or deviate from deterministic processes.

4.2 Secondary Successor Cascade (5 Levels)

If Continuity Trust fails, refuses succession, or faces disqualification, cascade activates:

Level 1: Institutional archive designated in Document 29 MJMP with longest continuous operation and highest jurisdiction scores. Level 2: Academic institution with established digital preservation, minimum 50-year history, endowment exceeding $1B. Level 3: International standards organization with global recognition, multi-decade history, governance resistant to single-nation capture. Level 4: Decentralized autonomous organization on established blockchain with minimum 5-year history and demonstrated governance stability. Level 5: Court-appointed receiver in master repository jurisdiction (Delaware) with specific MW preservation mandate.

Each level activates only upon documented failure of all higher-priority successors. Same trigger/verification framework applies at every cascade level.

4.3 Successor Qualification (All Required)

Legal capacity in minimum 15 jurisdictions. Financial resources for minimum 5 years independent operation. Proven digital infrastructure and cybersecurity expertise. Governance independence (no capture by single entity, government, or individual). Conflict-free status (no competing interests creating incentive to suppress or corrupt MW). Perpetual commitment in charter/instrument. Failure of any single criterion = automatic disqualification and cascade.

V. AUTHORITY TRANSFER MECHANISMS

5.1 Cryptographic Key Transfer

MW authority flows through Ed25519 signing keys controlling document certification, blockchain attestation, registry write authority, and official communications. Key transfer executes automatically within maximum 72 hours of trigger verification through a seven-step protocol designed to eliminate human judgment while ensuring cryptographic integrity:

Step 1 â€” Trigger Verification: Automated monitoring systems detect succession trigger and execute the verification protocol specific to trigger category (Section 3.2). Verification evidence is hashed (SHA3-512) and blockchain-attested on all three chains as permanent record.

Step 2 â€” Successor Notification: System generates Ed25519-signed succession notice transmitted to designated successor entity at pre-registered communication endpoints. Notice includes: trigger category, verification evidence hash, transfer timeline, authentication instructions, and deadline for Step 3 completion.

Step 3 â€” Successor Authentication: Designated successor executes pre-registered authentication protocol proving organizational identity and legal authority to receive transfer. Authentication requires: presentation of pre-shared organizational credentials (deposited at trust formation); verification of corporate good standing in formation jurisdiction; and confirmation of qualification criteria satisfaction (Section 4.3). Maximum 48 hours for authentication completion â€” failure triggers cascade to next level.

Step 4 â€” New Key Generation: System generates new Ed25519 key pair for successor entity using hardware security module meeting FIPS 140-2 Level 3+ certification. Key generation occurs in the successor's HSM â€” the system never transmits private keys. Public key is registered with SICA for ongoing verification.

Step 5 â€” Authority Migration: Blockchain attestation records authority transfer on all three chains (Ethereum smart contract event, Bitcoin OP_RETURN, Arweave permanent metadata). Attestation includes: predecessor entity identifier, successor entity identifier, trigger category code, verification evidence hash, predecessor public key (being revoked), successor public key (being activated), and UTC timestamp.

Step 6 â€” Legacy Key Revocation: Founder's Ed25519 keys enter permanent revocation status. Revocation certificate published to all three blockchains. SICA key registry updated. All mirror sites receive revocation notice within 60 seconds per Document 29 MJMP synchronization requirements. From this moment, any artifact or communication signed with the revoked keys is automatically rejected by all MW systems.

Step 7 â€” Continuity Verification: System executes test operations using successor keys: test registry entry (immediately voided after successful recording); test artifact signature verification; test blockchain attestation; and test API authentication. All tests must pass before operational authority transfers. Failed tests trigger immediate investigation â€” if irrecoverable within 24 hours, cascade to next level.

Entire transfer protocol targets 24-hour completion with 72-hour maximum. Transfer failures at any step trigger automatic escalation. The 72-hour window is absolute â€” if primary successor cannot complete within 72 hours regardless of reason, the system cascades to the next qualified entity without exception.

5.2 Financial Control Transfer

Financial system access transfers simultaneously with cryptographic authority, ensuring no gap between operational authority and financial capability:

Bank accounts: successor entity officers added as authorized signatories through pre-positioned banking resolutions; founder authorization removed simultaneously; dual-control maintained throughout transition. Payment processing: Stripe account administrative control transferred with automated notification to all active subscribers explaining succession and confirming uninterrupted service; subscriber billing continues without interruption. Investment accounts: authority over reserve funds, endowment assets, and operational capital transferred to successor with fiduciary accounting of all assets at transfer date. Tax authority: IRS and state agency records updated designating successor as responsible party; transition-period tax obligations clearly allocated between predecessor and successor.

Financial institutions receive advance contractual notice of automatic transfer provisions at account opening. All banking, payment processing, and investment agreements include mandatory succession cooperation clauses. Refusal to honor transfer provisions constitutes material breach triggering immediate relationship termination, asset migration to compliant institutions, and liquidated damages for transition costs.

5.3 Legal Relationship Transfer

All MW legal relationships transfer automatically to successor without requiring counterparty consent through pre-positioned legal documentation:

Intellectual property: automatic assignment of all copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and pending applications to successor entity with recordation in USPTO, WIPO, and all relevant national registries. Successor receives complete IP portfolio documentation including registration numbers, renewal dates, and enforcement history.

Contracts: successor assumes all rights and obligations under existing agreements including vendor contracts, institutional licenses, compliance commitments, and technology service agreements. Anti-assignment clauses in third-party contracts are superseded by MW's contractual succession provisions (included in all MW agreements from initial execution).

Litigation: successor obtains standing in all pending or threatened legal proceedings with automatic party substitution under applicable procedural rules. Litigation files, legal strategy documents, and counsel relationships transfer completely.

Regulatory relationships: successor becomes regulated entity for all applicable frameworks with proactive notification to every relevant regulatory agency. Regulatory compliance history and correspondence archives transfer completely.

Infrastructure: DNS registrations, SSL/TLS certificates, hosting agreements, cloud services accounts, and monitoring system credentials transfer to successor with verified continuity testing before go-live.

VI. OPERATIONAL CONTINUITY

6.1 Zero-Downtime Mandate

Succession must not interrupt MW Infrastructure Stack availability or functionality. The Protocol mandates unbroken continuity across four operational dimensions:

Continuous certification: Ongoing institutional certification processing without delay, backlog, or quality degradation during transition. The binary decision tree logic (Document 25 BDTM) executes identically regardless of which entity operates the infrastructure â€” identical inputs produce identical outputs whether the founder or the Continuity Trust is operating the system.

Uninterrupted document access: All mirror locations (Document 29 MJMP) continue serving canonical documents throughout transition. Mirror infrastructure operates independently of the succession process â€” mirrors don't know or care about who controls the master repository's administrative functions, they simply synchronize content.

Payment processing continuity: License payments and subscription renewals continue without service interruption. Stripe's programmatic API enables seamless backend transfer without affecting active subscriptions or payment methods on file.

Incident response maintenance: Technical support and emergency response capabilities must remain operational throughout transition. Pre-positioned successor infrastructure operates in hot-standby mode with duplicate monitoring, alerting, and response capabilities that activate automatically upon trigger detection.

Zero-downtime is achievable specifically because of the MW system's deterministic architecture â€” all processes execute from canonical documents through automated protocols. The founder (or any successor) does not make decisions during normal operations; they maintain infrastructure. Changing who maintains infrastructure while keeping the infrastructure running is an engineering problem, not a governance problem, and SCTP solves it through pre-positioning.

6.2 Institutional Communication Protocol

Succession events trigger mandatory multi-channel notification to all reliant institutions within 24 hours of trigger verification. Communications include: (1) Trigger category disclosure with verification evidence summary (sufficient for institutional due diligence without compromising privacy â€” e.g., "succession activated pursuant to Section 3.1 Category 1 trigger" rather than detailed personal information). (2) Successor entity complete legal identification â€” name, jurisdiction of formation, governance structure, trustee identity, and Trust Protector identity. (3) Continuity assurance â€” explicit confirmation of zero operational disruption, ongoing Protocol compliance, and preservation of all existing certifications, licenses, and service commitments. (4) Independent verification instructions â€” blockchain transaction references enabling any party to independently verify succession legitimacy through Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Arweave explorers without trusting any MW-affiliated party's claims. (5) Updated contact information â€” communication channels, support endpoints, escalation procedures, and emergency contacts for successor entity.

Communications deploy through: direct email to all registered institutional contacts (primary channel); prominent notice on all operational mirror homepages; immutable blockchain publication on all three attestation chains; social media through official MW channels; and third-party notification through Zenodo, GitHub, and academic research networks. Redundant delivery ensures that no institutional consumer can reasonably claim ignorance of the succession event.

6.3 Post-Succession Audit (90-Day Mandatory Period)

Succession events activate a 90-day mandatory audit during which five parallel verification streams operate:

Independent compliance audit: Third-party auditor (Big Four or equivalent) verifies complete succession Protocol compliance â€” every step from trigger detection through authority transfer examined against SCTP requirements with binary pass/fail determination for each step.

Institutional due diligence: Reliant institutions conduct their own review of successor entity qualification, governance structure, and financial stability. Successor entity must respond to institutional inquiries within 5 business days during audit period.

Technical integrity audit: Comprehensive system examination confirming: zero unauthorized modification of canonical documents (SHA3-512 hash verification against blockchain attestation for all 39 documents); zero unauthorized modification of certification logic or fee formulas; registry integrity verification (complete hash chain validation per Document 28); and mirror synchronization verification (all mirrors byte-identical per Document 29).

Financial reconciliation: Complete accounting of all financial transactions during transition â€” revenue received, expenses paid, assets transferred, endowment status. Independent verification that no funds were misdirected, misappropriated, or unaccounted for during the transition window.

Governance validation: Legal review confirming successor entity's corporate good standing, trust instrument compliance, qualification criteria satisfaction, and authority to operate in all relevant jurisdictions.

All audit results publish publicly with detailed findings, exception reports, and remediation timelines for any identified deficiencies. Clean audit results provide institutional consumers with independent confirmation that succession executed correctly and the system's integrity is uncompromised.

VII. WHY SCTP EXISTS

The Founder-as-Single-Point-of-Failure Problem: Every founder-dependent organization faces the same existential risk â€” what happens when the founder is no longer available? Most organizations address this through vague succession planning, board-level discretion, or hope that the right people will figure it out. These approaches work tolerably for organizations where institutional consumers can switch providers if succession goes wrong. But for the MW Infrastructure Stack, where institutional consumers (banks, insurers, courts, corporations) are making multi-decade reliance decisions based on the system's permanence guarantees, "we'll figure it out" is catastrophically inadequate.

Consider the practical stakes: a bond trustee managing $500M in FAPA-certified assets needs mathematical certainty that the certification infrastructure will survive any founder event. If the founder dies and succession is unclear, the trustee faces immediate questions: Is the FAPA PERPETUAL certificate still valid? Who has authority to verify it? Who maintains the registry? If these questions cannot be answered instantly and definitively, the trustee may need to treat all FAPA certifications as unreliable â€” triggering bond covenant violations, credit downgrades, and potential institutional losses across every entity relying on FAPA certifications.

SCTP provides mathematical certainty through four mechanisms: deterministic triggers (no committee meetings, no board votes, no politics â€” succession happens automatically upon objective events); pre-positioned successor infrastructure (the Continuity Trust exists and is operational before the system launches, not created after a crisis); cryptographic authority transfer (successor legitimacy is provable through blockchain attestation â€” any party can independently verify that the entity claiming MW authority actually received a legitimate transfer); and a 5-level cascade ensuring that even if the primary successor fails, four additional fallback entities are pre-specified and pre-qualified. The system doesn't need the founder to continue operating â€” it needs the founder to stop operating incorrectly for succession to activate automatically.

The Hostile Succession Problem: Without SCTP's automated mechanisms, succession creates opportunity for capture. In traditional organizational succession, a founder's estate executors, a commercial acquirer, a government agency, or a hostile party could claim authority over the organization and modify it for personal benefit â€” changing fee structures, granting favorable certifications to allies, suppressing unfavorable determinations, or extracting value from the institutional trust the system has built.

Traditional succession mechanisms (wills, corporate bylaws, board votes) are all vulnerable because they depend on human judgment and institutional processes that can be influenced. A will can be contested. A board can be captured through proxy fights. Corporate bylaws can be amended by majority vote. Each of these mechanisms creates attack surfaces that a sufficiently motivated party could exploit, particularly when the MW system's revenue represents significant financial incentive.

SCTP eliminates capture risk through: objective triggers (no human determines when succession happens â€” death certificates, court orders, and sanctions designations are verifiable facts, not opinions); blockchain-attested authority transfer (successor legitimacy is cryptographically provable â€” a party claiming MW authority either has a valid blockchain-attested key transfer or doesn't, with no middle ground); immutable canonical documents (no successor can modify the document stack because modifications would produce different SHA3-512 hashes that don't match blockchain attestation, and reliant institutions would immediately detect the discrepancy); and the Continuity Trust structure (a purpose-locked Delaware statutory trust that legally cannot deviate from MW stewardship â€” the trust instrument specifically prohibits modification of canonical documents, fee structures, and certification criteria, and the Trust Protector has authority to remove any trustee who attempts such modifications).

The Institutional Permanence Problem: MW certifications create dependencies that outlast any individual's lifetime. A PERPETUAL certificate has no expiration date â€” the institution relying on it needs the verification infrastructure to operate for 30, 50, or 100+ years. No individual can guarantee personal availability for those timeframes. Human mortality alone ensures that any founder-dependent system will experience succession within decades.

But the permanence problem extends beyond mortality. Even a living founder may become unavailable through incapacitation, legal restriction (criminal conviction, sanctions designation), financial distress (bankruptcy), or simple burnout. Any of these events, if not pre-addressed with deterministic succession protocols, creates the same institutional crisis as death â€” uncertainty about system continuity that undermines reliance.

SCTP ensures that the system's permanence depends on institutional architecture rather than individual availability: a cascade of 5 successor entities, each with perpetual commitment provisions and independent financial resources; endowment requirements ensuring minimum 5 years of operation without any revenue; blockchain-verifiable governance preventing unauthorized modifications; and the fundamental design principle that the MW Infrastructure Stack runs on documents, not people. The canonical documents execute identically regardless of which entity operates the infrastructure â€” succession changes the operator but not the operation.

The Cross-Border Succession Problem: MW operates across 170+ jurisdictions. A succession event (particularly death or incapacitation) triggers different legal consequences in different jurisdictions. Estate laws vary â€” some jurisdictions impose forced heirship rules that could theoretically claim MW assets. Regulatory frameworks differ â€” a successor recognized in Delaware might need separate recognition in the EU, Singapore, and Brazil. Tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions may assert claims during succession transitions.

SCTP pre-empts cross-border complications through: Delaware statutory trust formation (choosing the jurisdiction with the most favorable trust law and the strongest protections against forced heirship claims); automatic assignment clauses in all external contracts (ensuring relationship continuity without per-jurisdiction counterparty consent); blockchain attestation creating jurisdiction-neutral proof of legitimate authority transfer; and the New York Convention ensuring that ICC arbitration awards resolving succession disputes are enforceable in 170+ signatory nations. The succession mechanism is designed to work identically regardless of which jurisdiction the founder is in, which jurisdictions reliant institutions operate from, and which jurisdictions external service providers are based in.

VIII. INSTITUTIONAL RELIANCE PRESERVATION

8.1 Certification Validity Guarantee: All pre-succession certifications retain full validity regardless of successor identity. Prohibited: retroactive decertification; requalification demands; fee structure changes for active licenses; and service level degradation.

8.2 Liability Continuity: Successors assume all predecessor liabilities â€” contractual obligations, warranty claims, indemnification, and compliance violations â€” through explicit trust instrument and corporate governance provisions preventing repudiation.

8.3 Reliance Standard Preservation: Succession cannot modify: certification criteria; canonical document content; pricing formulas; or service commitments. Modifications require Protocol amendment through specified procedures unrelated to succession. Attempted unauthorized modifications void successor legitimacy and trigger cascade.

________________


IX. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

9.1 Challenge Procedures: Written challenge to independent arbitration (ICC, Zurich) within 60 days of succession notification. Process: challenge filing â†’ evidence review â†’ independent technical audit â†’ jurisdictional legal analysis â†’ binding determination.

9.2 Wrongful Succession Remedies: Authority revocation (immediate key termination); asset recovery; institutional emergency notification; damage compensation; and criminal referral. Permanent disqualification from future eligibility.

9.3 Competing Claims: Priority ranking â€” (1) earliest valid trigger verification; (2) highest cascade position; (3) strongest cryptographic proof; (4) arbitration panel designation if above inconclusive. Competing claims suspend succession actions â€” MW continues on automated protocols during resolution.

________________


X. LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY

10.1 Endowment: Minimum $10M liquid diversified assets funding 5 years of independent operation. Investment: maximum 60% equities, minimum 30% fixed income, maximum 10% alternatives; no more than 50% in single-country securities; maximum 15% single-sector exposure; minimum 20% convertible to cash within 30 days. Withdrawals for MW operations only â€” personal enrichment = fiduciary violation = successor removal.

10.2 Revenue Self-Sufficiency: Licensing revenue per Document 5. Prohibited: charitable dependency (donations/grants); government subsidy (political capture risk); operational debt financing; and core asset liquidation. Annual sustainability assessment â€” failure triggers succession.

10.3 Perpetual Commitment: No sunset provisions, exit strategies, or termination contemplation. Charter provisions: perpetual duration; prohibition on MW sale to commercial entities; irrevocable mission lock (MW preservation as sole purpose); and dissolution impossibility absent complete compliance impossibility. These provisions bind across unlimited succession events.
